Clinton says she would like to run Facebook,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/LtkJjuEXSZ0/clinton-says-would-like-to-run-facebook.html,Fox_Politics,Fox,['Lukas Mikelionis'],,"[""Hillary Clinton didn't win the presidency in 2016, so is there another job she would like to have? The former Democratic Party nominee considered the question Friday at Harvard University and said she would like to run Facebook.\n\nDuring an event at which she received the prestigious Radcliffe Medal for “transformative impact on society,” Clinton was asked which company she would like to lead as CEO.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Clinton named Facebook, noting that the social media giant has vast power and controls the flow of information.\n\n“It’s the biggest news platform in the world … but most people in our country get their news, true or not, from Facebook,” she said.\n\nThe response drew mixed reactions on social media, though the attempt to put her name on the table may not be so out of the ordinary. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg openly endorsed Clinton’s candidacy while a co-founder of the social media giant, Dustin Moskovitz, led a nearly $30 million effort to defeat now-President Donald Trump.\n\nOther Facebook employees contributed more money to Clinton's campaign -- some $114,000 -- than to those of any other candidate, according to Federal Election Commission data that takes into account only donations over $200, the Hill reported.\n\nBut the former U.S. secretary of state’s openness to run Facebook came at the time when the tech company is coping with a number of scandals, including alleged misuse of user data that allowed political campaigns, including possibly Clinton’s, to target potential voters after acquiring the data of millions of people.\n\nJust this week, Facebook was accused of deceptive tactics to pressure people to accept its privacy policy. According to a complaint filed by the European Center for Digital Rights on behalf of an anonymous individual, the platform blocked users who didn’t consent to the new privacy policies and used “tricks” – including fake message notifications – to pressure them into agreeing with the policies.\n\n“[Facebook] used additional ‘tricks’ to pressure the users: For example, the consent page included two fake red dots … that indicated that the user has new messages and notifications, which he/she cannot access without consenting — even if the user did not have such notifications or messages in reality,” the complaint reads, according to Australia's News.co.au.\n\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN APP MAY HAVE HARVESTED FACEBOOK DATA OF MILLIONS\n\nBut similar to Cambridge Analytica, the company that was forced to shut down amid the data misuse scandal, the Clinton campaign itself may have harvested the data of potentially millions of users to get an edge over Trump.\n\nIn the midst of the election, Clinton's campaign launched a mobile application called “Hillary 2016” that allowed every user to pair their friends list on Facebook with their phone contacts – and give the campaign permission to access that info.\n\nPeople who didn’t download the application - or weren’t even Clinton supporters – weren’t given an option to prohibit their Facebook friends from pairing their phone numbers with Facebook accounts and indicate their likelihood of voting for the Democratic candidate.""]",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/25/0/0/694940094001_5789844228001_5789843101001-vs.jpg?ve=1

Rudy Giuliani says he's counseled Trump against firing Sessions,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/7eHDXitbk7c/rudy-giuliani-says-hes-counseled-trump-against-firing-sessions.html,Fox_Politics,Fox,[],,"['President Donald Trump’s lawyer has repeatedly counseled him not to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions despite the president’s ongoing anger at the attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe.\n\nRudy Giuliani told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Trump has asked him multiple times, before and after the former New York City mayor joined the president’s legal team last month, about whether Sessions should have been fired.\n\n“I don’t think the president should do it and I’ve told him so,” said Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani said Trump consulted him last summer during the height of his rage about Sessions’ recusal. More recently, he said, Trump has not actively considered firing Sessions, but has wondered if he made the right decision in not doing so previously.\n\n“And when he asks ‘Should I have done that?’ I say ‘No, the way it is now has worked out’,” Giuliani said.\n\nThe former mayor added that he did not believe Trump would fire Sessions. The president’s anger at Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse his fledgling presidential campaign and has remained a loyal supporter, comes from the attorney general’s move last year to recuse himself from the probe, a move Sessions said was in line with Department of Justice guidelines but Trump believes birthed the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller that is imperiling his presidency.\n\nTrump’s anger remains unabated and he suggested on Twitter again Wednesday that he wishes he had never offered the job to Sessions. Giuliani stressed that Trump had every right — whether in person or on social media — to “express how he feels” about Sessions, but suggested it was a distraction to his legal team’s efforts to fight back against the ongoing investigation.\n\n“Instead of talking about Sessions, we want to be talking about Comey and Mueller,” said Giuliani, invoking the former FBI director and the special counsel. “Public opinion is turning our way; we’ve had a great turnaround on this. We should be focused on that.”\n\nSome in Trump’s inner circle have advised him against firing the attorney general because it could further ratchet up the pressure in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, as well as alienate a portion of the president’s conservative base who have cheered Sessions’ moves at the Justice Department. Moreover, a number of Sessions’ former Republican colleagues in the Senate have indicated they would not hold confirmation hearings for a replacement attorney general.\n\nThis could change after the midterm elections in November. Republicans on Capitol Hill want to avoid unnecessary drama ahead of the elections, but once Mueller completes his investigation some are now suggesting it may then be time for Trump and Sessions to part ways.\n\nThe mood is a shift from just weeks ago when Republican senators in particular seemed prepared to go to the mat for Sessions as part of their broader efforts to stop Trump from firing Mueller.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who golfed over the holiday weekend with the president, says he has reinforced to Trump that “the best thing for the Republican Party right now is to keep focused on good governance in the midterms.”\n\nGraham says while he shares some of Trump’s frustrations with the situation — particularly the Justice Department’s resistance to appointing a second special counsel to investigate the handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe — he doesn’t expect Sessions will depart “any time soon.”\n\nBut Graham added, these are “not lifetime appointments.” At some point, he said, Sessions will “have to make a decision” that if “you don’t have the confidence” of the president, “that will affect your ability to be effective.”']",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/31/0/0/694940094001_5791606769001_5791604008001-vs.jpg?ve=1
Top GOP senator challenges Fusion GPS founder over 'extremely misleading' testimony on Trump dossier,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/3bCPPq4mpac/top-gop-senator-challenges-fusion-gps-founder-over-extremely-misleading-testimony-on-trump-dossier.html,Fox_Politics,Fox,['Catherine Herridge'],,"['A top Republican senator is accusing the founder of opposition research firm Fusion GPS of providing testimony that was “extremely misleading, if not an outright lie,” regarding the anti-Trump dossier.\n\nFusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson was asked about his firm’s work on the dossier during closed-door testimony in August 2017. When asked specifically whether that work continued after the 2016 election, Simpson responded: “I had no client after the election.”\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, however, challenged that answer in a new letter to committee colleague Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del. “As we now know, that was extremely misleading, if not an outright lie,” he wrote.\n\nHe said that, “Contrary to Mr. Simpson’s denial in the staff interview, according to the FBI and others, Fusion actually did continue Trump dossier work for a new client after the election.”\n\nThe letter cites the House Intelligence Committee’s Republican-authored Russia report, which included a footnote detailing a March 2017 interview between the FBI and Daniel J. Jones, a former staffer for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. According to the footnote, Jones told agents he was leading a research organization called the Penn Quarter Group, which had “secured the services” of dossier author and former British spy Christopher Steele; an associate; and Fusion GPS “to continue exposing Russian interference” after the election.\n\nThe committee report said that the Penn Quarter Group “was being funded by 7 to 10 wealthy donors located primarily in New York and California, who provided approximately $50 million.” Grassley noted that Jones said his group planned to “push the information he obtained from Fusion and Steele to policymakers on Capitol Hill, the press, and the FBI.”\n\nJones, according to his LinkedIn profile, worked four years for the FBI doing “international analysis” and as a staffer for Feinstein. Feinstein, who is the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary committee, unilaterally released a transcript of Simpson’s testimony in January.\n\nGrassley said Simpson and Jones’ statements are subject to the federal statute 18 USC 1001, which bars lying to federal investigators. “So, despite the fact Mr. Simpson said he had no client after the election, he in fact did, and that client revealed himself to the FBI,” he wrote.\n\nGrassley, working with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., back in January sent a criminal referral on Steele to the Justice Department – claiming the ex-spy lied about his contact with the media regarding allegations against members of the Trump campaign. “As with the circumstances surrounding the Steele referral, we once again have two seemingly contradictory statements in contexts where material lies are criminal. I would welcome your views on what actions you are willing to take with regard to Mr. Simpson’s testimony,” Grassley wrote.\n\nGrassley wrote the letter in response to Coons’ concerns about potential inconsistencies in Donald Trump Jr.’s committee interview. Grassley countered with his own concerns.\n\nSeparately, as reported by Fox News, after much legal wrangling on both sides of the Atlantic, Steele is expected to sit down for a videotaped deposition on June 18 in London for civil litigation filed against Buzzfeed, which published the unverified Steele memos in January 2017. The Steele-written memos were funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton through Washington, D.C.-based law firm Perkins Coie, which hired Fusion GPS for $1.8 million. The unverified information was also used by the FBI and pushed to various journalists during the 2016 campaign.\n\nEvan Fray-Witzer, the Boston-based lawyer for Russian technology executive Aleksej Gubarev, who is suing Buzzfeed for defamation of his companies, said in a statement: “We look forward to asking both Mr. Steele and Mr. Simpson about the work they performed after the election, which is when the memo concerning our clients was written. Obviously, if the work was performed for the Penn Quarter Group, it’s just more evidence that this was paid-for, private opposition research and not – as Buzzfeed tries to portray it – some sort of ‘government investigation.’”\n\nThere was no immediate response from Simpson’s attorney or Daniel Jones.\n\nMaking materially false or fraudulent statements to Congress can be pushishable by fines and imprisonment of up to eight years in prison.']",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/30/0/0/694940094001_5791567686001_5791565179001-vs.jpg?ve=1

Congress mulls lowering age requirement for truck drivers to prevent national shortage,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/cw7xjwLbJfM/congress-mulls-lowering-age-requirement-for-truck-drivers-to-prevent-national-shortage.html,Fox_Politics,Fox,['Terace Garnier'],,"['When Juwan Mack turned 21, one of the first things he did was carry out his dream. The South Carolina resident applied for, and received, his trucking license.\n\n“I remember as a kid always being at my grandma’s house. Her house was right next to a main highway,” Mack said. “So, I remember being on the side of the road and a truck would come by and I would pull my hand down for them to beep the horn…childhood dreams.”\n\nBut Mack, now a truck driver for CCC Transportation, had to wait years for that dream to become a reality, thanks to a law that requires drivers of commercial vehicles to be over 21 to cross state lines.\n\nNow, Congress is considering a new piece of legislation proposed by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., called the Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy Act, also known as the DRIVE-Safe Act. It aims to allow 18 year olds with their commercial driver’s licenses, or CDLs, the ability to drive commercial vehicles across state lines in an attempt to help prevent a nationwide driver shortage.\n\nMost states allow truck drivers under 21 to crisscross a state, but those 18 to 20 are not allowed to cross state lines.\n\nMany truckers are reaching retirement age in the next decade and leaving the workforce, and companies say they are having a tough time hiring new drivers. In South Carolina alone, more than 8,200 locally owned trucking companies said they were suffering from a driver shortage.\n\nThe American Trucking Association published a report in October of 2017 showing that last year’s national shortage of 50,000 drivers may increase to 174,000 drivers by 2026.\n\n“The truckers would need to hire close to one million truckers over the next 10 years. You have a lot of people retiring,” Hunter said.\n\nSupporters say lowering the age limit would expand the labor pool. While the pay is decent – the average trucker’s salary is about $60,000 a year – it’s a tough job that requires drivers to be on the road for months at a time.\n\n“It’s such a crisis with the shortage of truck drivers – you can ask any business person, any fleet operator, any private business that has their own fleet one of their biggest problems is workforce, in particularly truck drivers,” said Rick Todd, president of the South Carolina Trucking Association.\n\nThe apprenticeship program would require the drivers under 21 years old to complete, at minimum, 400 hours of on-duty time, including at least 240 hours of driving time chaperoned by an experienced driver and equip all training trucks with cameras and a set a speed cap of 65 mph.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation set the rule decades ago because of concerns that drivers under 21 had a higher risk for accidents.\n\nNow, the proposal has come under criticism by some who agree with the DOT, arguing that allowing younger drivers behind the wheel of a truck is a recipe for disaster.\n\n“Young drivers both lack overall experience and are less safe behind the wheel than their older counterpart,” Todd Spencer, president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, wrote in a letter to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which is exploring the issue. “In fact, commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers who are 19 to 20 years of age are six times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes.”\n\nThe association believes all efforts should instead focus on improving the industry instead of trying to hire more cheap labor.\n\n“This has been tried before and no one with any common sense thought it was a good idea,” Spencer wrote in the letter. “Nothing has changed since that time and no disruptions have ever taken place due to any perceived shortage of drivers. These latest efforts are just more ways to keep driver-churn going and keep wages as low as possible.”\n\nBut Hunter said the change is necessary because the trucking industry keeps America going by delivering goods, ranging from fresh vegetables to petroleum, around the country – and costs will go up on goods and the availability of those goods will go down if the issue isn’t addressed.\n\n“There is no downside to doing this because you already have people on the road that are in the ages of 18 to 21. They went through all of the training, all the safety stuff. So they’re already doing it, they just simply can’t drive over the state line,” Hunter said. “So, I think this fixes a dumb issue that Congress needs to fix.”\n\nMack feels the legislation is important and will help the industry bring in younger drivers.\n\n“I feel like a lot of kids that are underage will jump into it because there is no longer a wait,” Mack said, “you know, no limitation on where you can go or how far you can drive.”']",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/30/0/0/694940094001_5791546303001_5791538045001-vs.jpg?ve=1
Weak parties = More partisanship,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/6SIS_LVI9tI/weak-parties-more-partisanship.html,Fox_Politics,Fox,['Chris Stirewalt'],,"[""**Want FOX News Halftime Report in your inbox every day?

Here is obvious evidence that the Golden State is a one-party state in ways that not even Rhode Island or Alabama could muster.\n\n\n\nThese preliminary data are subject to official reversal by California secretary of state, but the larger message is irrefutable: The value of partisan affiliation is dropping like a rock in America’s most populous state.\n\n\n\nThat should come as no surprise since there has been a push for more than a decade to get away from the partisanship that many in California and across the country say is to blame for poor government and an inability to address pressing issues.\n\n\n\nThe most aggressive step taken by California was to end partisan primaries. Since 2012 voters of all registrations participate in the state’s June primary elections with the top two finishers, regardless of affiliation, meeting up for a runoff in November.\n\n\n\nThis was the brain child of moderates, both Republican and Democrat, who observed that the primary system as constituted in most of the country provides too great an incentive for extremism. By essentially eliminating primaries, California reformers reasoned, they would eliminate the extremism that primaries produce.\n\n\n\nThis would be something like saying that you only find out about having cavities when you go to the dentist so you stop going to the dentist all together. Problem solved.\n\n\n\nPartisan affiliation for most of American history was a function of class, ethnicity and geography. You were a Democrat or Republican because everyone you knew was one, just like your father and grandfather and great grandfather… There were liberal rock-ribbed Republicans in the Northeast and conservative yellow dog Democrats in the Deep South.\n\n\n\nBut the rise of a truly national media in the form of talk radio, cable news and, most of all, the internet, has facilitated what political scientist Mo Fiorina says is a better “sorted” electorate. The conservative Republican base has driven out liberals while the liberal Democratic base has driven out conservatives, and those who harbor dissenting views but still remain have strong incentives to remain quiet.\n\nSo many voters feel alienated these days not because the parties have become more polarized but because the parties have become so homogenous. People have tangled oftentimes seemingly contradictory views and seldom fit into narrow ideological silos. And as the parties have become more ideological it has deepened the sense of alienation for many.\n\n\n\nParties were less ideological 50 years ago and tended to reflect coalitions of regional factions that could cobble together politically competitive efforts. Now parties are more ideological since the old cultural bonds that kept people in their political lanes have substantially broken down. If anybody tell you that “all politics is local,” tell them to look at the ads politicians are running in 2018 midterms.\n\n\n\nIn this well-sorted space, there is greater incentive for ideological extremism. Incumbent members of Congress who would have once run for re-election on their own records and value to the district now race to the right or left to accommodate the demands of activist voters keyed up on immigration or impeachment or whatever is causing the deepest electric thrum to vibrate through the electorate.\n\n\n\nPartisan primaries may reveal those trends, but they are hardly the cause of them, as Californians are beginning to find out.\n\n\n\nIt is not hard to imagine that within the next decade the number of unaffiliated voters will also grow beyond the number of Democrats. Without the incentive of primary participation who wants to join a political party? Neither brand is particularly popular – for good reason – and partisanship in general has a bad reputation.\n\n\n\nSo what does that future look like? Probably more chaotic but even more factious. When these red and blue dinosaurs die off, they will not be replaced by new megafauna but rather a profusion of small scavengers.\n\n\n\nOver here are the Democratic socialists. Over there are the white nationalists. Up yonder is La Raza. Down there are the Libertarians.\n\n\n\nMany Americans have long yearned for a “third party.” They came awfully close in 1992 with Ross Perot’s aggressive pragmatism and flipcharts, and the desire for something that seems like a compromise between conservatives and liberals hasn’t abated. But the problem is you don’t get one more party. You get 10 more or 20 more.\n\n\n\nOnce we decide that we want “something else” than the two mainstream offerings it throws wide the doors to the kind of narrow-interest politics that bedevil many other nations.\n\nImagine the California primary of 2028 in which the top two finishers in a crowded field each claim less than a fifth of the vote and in November voters are left to choose between two candidates who got there by being ablest to energize the loudest, crankiest subset of supporters. Folks would be begging for authoritarian oligarchs after a few cycles of that.\n\n\n\nThere are lots of things that could be done to make America’s two-party system better.\n\nThe combination of misguided but well-intentioned campaign finance reforms that weakened national parties and a Supreme Court decision that empowered unaccountable outside groups has been particularly damaging. There may be some solutions there. And certainly the improved ability of partisans through voter data to draw ever more tortured congressional districts needs some consideration, too.\n\nBut whatever the solution for ways in which weak parties are unequal to our moment of strong partisanship it seems unlikely to us that the best remedy is to weaken them even further.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: THE FRESHMAKER\n\n“…there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice [if the Supreme Court had been made subordinate to the legislative branch].” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 81\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: OLD HICKORY DIDN’T MISS\n\nTennessee State Museum: “In the spring of 1806, Andrew Jackson and Charles Dickinson had a series of disagreements. … One argument concerned a horse race scheduled between Jackson’s horse Truxton and a horse owned by [Dickinson’s father in law]. …Dickinson publicly said insulting things about Jackson’s wife Rachel. … Finally Dickinson wrote a statement that was published in a Nashville newspaper calling Jackson a coward… Jackson wrote a letter challenging Dickinson to a duel. … [On this date 212 years ago] the two men and their seconds met in Kentucky for the duel (Dueling was outlawed in Tennessee). … Dickinson shot first, hitting Jackson in the chest.

Republicans have aired more than 14,000 campaign ads touting a tough Trump-style immigration platform this year. The barrage underscores why House GOP leaders worry that passing a legislative fix for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, referred to as DREAMers, would put GOP candidates at risk heading into the fall election. … Democrats bombard voters with ads that promise to protect Obamacare, shore up Social Security and expand Medicare, according to the data from Kantar’s Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG).”\n\n\n\nTrump focuses outreach on big donors - Politico: “President Donald Trump is plunging into the big-donor game, planning an appearance at a six-figure-a-head fundraiser benefiting his allied super PAC. Trump is expected to address America First Action’s leadership summit, according to the super PAC’s president, Brian Walsh. The president is slated to speak on the second night of the two-day conference, to be held June 18-19 at Trump International Hotel in Washington. Getting in won’t come cheap. Donors will need to pony up at least $100,000 to attend; VIP status will be at least $250,000. While the president has lent his support to the group and appeared at benefit dinners for America First Action’s backers, he has yet to appear at a fundraiser for it. Under federal law, Trump can only ask for donations of up to $5,000 for any super PAC, though he can appear at the event. The super PAC will begin sending out invitations to major GOP donors on Wednesday.”\n\n\n\nPhoenix mayor resigns to run for Congress - Fox News: “Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, an anti-Trump Democrat who has held the post in Arizona's capital city for more than six years, stepped down Tuesday to focus on a run for Congress. Stanton first announced in October that he intended to run for the U.S. House seat currently occupied by departing Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who is seeking the U.S. Senate seat of retiring Republican Jeff Flake. Under Arizona's ‘resign to run’ law, Stanton had to resign from the mayorship by the end of May in order to maintain his federal candidacy. Wednesday is the filing deadline for the race in Arizona's 9th Congressional District, which is centered in Tempe and includes parts of nearby communities, including Phoenix. The primaries are scheduled for Aug. 28, and the general election will be Nov. 6. Stanton is expected to face at least two other Democrats, while as many as five Republicans are expected to run. Independent candidates and those representing smaller parties also will run.”\n\n\n\nTRUMP KEEPS UP SPY CLAIMS DESPITE GOWDY ASSURANCES\n\nThe Hill: “President Trump’s mind hasn’t been changed by a top Republican’s assessment the FBI acted appropriately in using a confidential source in the Russia probe, the White House said Wednesday. ‘Clearly, there’s still cause for concern that still needs to be looked at,’ White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. Sanders was responding to Rep. Trey Gowdy’s (R-S.C.) comments that ‘the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do’ by having a confidential source speak with Trump campaign associates who were suspected of having contacts with Russians during the 2016 election. His statements rebutted the president’s unsubstantiated claim that the Obama administration embedded a spy in the Trump campaign in order to boost Democrats.”\n\n\n\nTrump pushed Sessions to reverse recusal - NYT: “[President Trump’s] grievance was with Mr. Sessions: The president objected to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump, who had told aides that he needed a loyalist overseeing the inquiry, berated Mr. Sessions and told him he should reverse his decision, an unusual and potentially inappropriate request. Mr. Sessions refused. The confrontation, which has not been previously reported, is being investigated by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as are the president’s public and private attacks on Mr. Sessions and efforts to get him to resign. Mr. Trump dwelled on the recusal for months, according to confidants and current and former administration officials who described his behavior toward the attorney general. The special counsel’s interest demonstrates Mr. Sessions’s overlooked role as a key witness in the investigation into whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the inquiry itself.

BASEBALL\n\n“You woulda been thrown out at first if I was playing, buddy.” – A friendly taunt from Rep. Steve Scalise to Rep.

I once made a joke about my mother that she found so offensive she didn't speak to me for a week. If anyone knows about crossing lines in the pursuit of a joke, it would be me. But there's a HUGE difference between the lazy, all-encompassing bin of ‘political correctness’ and lines which should not be crossed. Making a joke about a long-maligned ethnic group at a time of increasing racial polarization would seem to be one of those common-sense times, and having a bipolar mental illness is not a sufficient excuse. ABC is in the business of risk. They cut her loose because her show was too risky based on their business model. I liked her reboot, and I missed the Connors. But if you think they caved merely due to ‘political correctness,’ then you have truly jumped the shark. That's too bad.” – Patrick S. Duffy, Los Angeles\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Oh dear, Mr. Duffy! I’m afraid I didn’t make myself clear enough here. The “new political correctness” we were talking about on Tuesday wasn’t the decision to scrap Roseanne Barr’s television show. The new political correctness we were discussing was the one in which people would defend a bigot or even change their taste in art for the sake of political tribalism. Conservatives complained for decades about P.C. and the enforcement of speech codes, etc. They had a point since we ought not be policing the free exchange of ideas or banning speech just to protect people’s feelings. But there is an increasingly strong impulse on the populist right these days to submit to the blunt judgement of the tribe when it comes to these matters. I hope most Americans will decline to engage passionately on the subject of what one television network did with one show, but many will simply on the grounds of tribal grievance. I have already seen plenty of “I’m not defending her, but….” Egads. How much proof does Barr have to provide that she’s far beyond the bounds of decency before people shun her? The new political correctness is different in many ways, but like the old, demands that you substitute the judgement of others for your own.]\n\n\n\n“Chris: Your Monday assessment of the ‘new political correctness’ in the light of Roseanne's latest outrageousness is razor sharp and diamond clear. I was cheering to myself at several points in the analysis. ‘If you are fool enough to allow strangers to dictate your likes or dislikes in music, movies, books and television there’s not much we can tell you...’ Amen.” – Jack Lavelle, Phoenix\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: We quote George Orwell here quite often and I think the occasion demands it again: “To see what is in front of one’s nose needs a constant struggle.” Thinking for oneself is HARD. Surrendering your will to the demands of the mob is easy. And now that mobs are easy to form and work in the close quarters of social media it’s getting harder to retain your own judgement, ethics and worldview. But it is certainly worth the fight!]\n\n\n\n“Stick shifts, be they three on a tree or four on the floor should stay, at least until ‘they’ can figure out how to automate a gas fill. Every day, millions fill their tanks the same way their grands and greats did over a century ago! Now that is something to complain about. It’s fun to drive with a clutch (look it up). Puttin’ on gas? Not so much.” – Bob Wood, Bismarck, N.D.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: You should know, Mr. Wood, that Brianna intervened on your behalf to include this reaction to Tuesday’s Time Out about the enduring popularity of manual transmission.

In addition to the metal tariffs, President Trump has threatened to impose levies on imported automobiles, the bulk of which comes from allies like Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the European Union.\n\nThe White House has tried to leverage the tariffs to get Canada and Mexico to agree to its demands on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and it has pressured Europe to make trade concessions on other fronts, including cutting the amount of metals the bloc exports to the United States.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration’s aggressive approach appears to have only hardened the resolve among the United States’ closest allies to fight back against Mr. Trump’s demands.']",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/business/31dc-tariffs-print/01dc-tariffs-1-facebookJumbo.jpg

Instead, he expressed his own grievances on Wednesday with what the network’s on-air personalities have said about him, and insisted he was the one who deserved an apology.\n\nSpecifically, the president called out Robert A. Iger, the chairman of Disney, the parent company of ABC, who had phoned the former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett, on Tuesday to apologize for Ms. Barr’s language. The president, referring to himself in the third person, complained on Twitter that Mr. Iger had “never called President Donald J.

Mr. Trump has reacted to other divisive events not by issuing statements of unity or moral clarity as other presidents might have done, but by finding equivalence or diverting attention.

After their meeting, Mr. Rosenstein gave Mr. McCabe a copy of a draft firing letter that Mr. Trump had written, according to two people familiar with the conversation. Mr. McCabe later gave that letter, and his memos, to Mr. Mueller.\n\nMr. McCabe’s memo reflects the anxiety of the early months of the Trump administration and presaged a relationship with law enforcement that has only grown more strained. Just as Mr. Comey kept memos on interactions with Mr. Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. McCabe documented his own conversations with the president and others.\n\nMr. Trump has injected himself into Justice Department operations in ways that have little precedent. While most presidents who have faced federal investigations have assiduously avoided discussing them for fear of being seen as trying to influence them, Mr. Trump has shown no hesitation. He has called the investigation a “witch hunt,” declared that a “deep state” was trying to undermine his presidency, and encouraged the Justice Department to provide sensitive details about the special counsel inquiry to Congress.\n\nMost recently, Mr. Trump has publicly demanded that the Justice Department investigate the Russia investigation itself.\n\nIn response, Mr. Rosenstein has walked a perilous line.

About 11 million of them were able to enroll as a result of states’ decisions to expand the program under the Affordable Care Act. Republican attempts to repeal the health law last year would have largely undone the Medicaid expansion and caused most of the new recipients to lose their coverage.\n\nVirginia’s House of Delegates voted to approve Medicaid expansion during the regular 60-day legislative session that ended in March. But the Senate, whose members were not up for re-election last fall, remained opposed. Lawmakers failed to pass a state budget then because of the issue.\n\n“That is debt, and I have four kids who are going to be having to pay for that for the rest of their lives,” Senator Amanda Chase, a Republican from Chesterfield, said of the federal funds spent on Medicaid expansion, explaining her vote against it on Wednesday. “It’s not just a fiscal burden, but it’s not the best solution for people who want real, quality health care.”\n\nThe turning point came in April when State Senator Frank Wagner, a Republican from Virginia Beach, said he had changed his position and would support Medicaid expansion, joining one other Republican, Senator Emmett W.

You\'re sorry that they forced you to experience all this,"" he said. ""But in another way, it was impossible.""\n\nIn Babchenko\'s telling, Ukrainian security services had saved his life. They informed him that a hit was ordered on him from Russia, and the money had already been transferred: $40,000 (something Babchenko ironically described as a respectable price on his head).\n\nUkrainian officials said they had foiled a deadly plot, and that the person suspected of carrying out an attempted assassination attempt on Babchenko was in custody. But despite the surprise ending, the Ukrainians handed a public-relations gift to the Russian government.\n\n""That Babchenko is alive is the best news,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Facebook. ""Wish it was always like that. It\'s too bad that in other cases, the masquerade didn\'t quite come off.""\n\nZakharova said the Ukrainian story had been concocted for ""propagandistic effect."" Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev compared the Babchenko case to the Salisbury poisonings , something used ""by hook or by crook to defame Russia.""\n\nAnd that\'s likely a point that Russian officials will further amplify. Russia has vehemently denied any responsibility for the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury, much as it has denied backing separatists in Ukraine\'s Donbas region and meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Earlier Wednesday, before Babchenko\'s surprise reappearance, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the West was using the case ""to promote Russophobic views and to create an uncomfortable situation for our country in every possible way,"" state news agency TASS reported.\n\nThat response -- accusing the West of stirring a campaign of Russophobia -- has been the default Russian response to everything from the Skripal case to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine in 2014. In each case, the Russian government issued furious denials and charged the West with creating ""fake news"" to blacken Russia\'s name.\n\nIn the case of Babchenko, they can now claim that fake news is real. And others are questioning why the Ukrainians staged Babchenko\'s death.\n\n""We are relieved that Arkady Babchenko is alive,"" said Nina Ognianova, the Europe and Central Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""Ukrainian authorities must now disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the Russian journalist\'s murder. CPJ is investigating this unprecedented situation and will have no further comment until we have more details.""\n\nBabchenko is no stranger to controversy. Last year, he fled Russia, saying he was subject to a campaign of harassment ""so personal, so scary,"" that he was forced to flee his native country.\n\nThe main trigger for this wave of harassment? A Facebook post. In December 2016, a Russian plane carrying the Alexandrov Ensemble, a much-loved military choir, crashed into the Black Sea on the way to a performance for Russian troops at a base in Syria. Babchenko said he used the post -- in which he refused to express sympathy for the crash victims -- to remind readers that Russia was also backing the Syrian government in a brutal offensive against the city of Aleppo.\n\nRussians reacted angrily. Prominent lawmakers and state media vilified him, and Babchenko said he no longer felt safe in Russia\n\n""My home address has also been published on the Internet, together with an invitation \'to visit,\'"" Babchenko wrote. ""I have received threats to me and my family by the thousand -- in my email inbox, on Facebook and by phone.""\n\nBabchenko in many respects has had an extraordinary career. Before working as a journalist, he served as a conscript soldier in Russia\'s 1994-96 war against Chechen separatists. He then returned to military service as a contract soldier during a second war in Chechnya that began in 1999. That second conflict helped propel Russian President Vladimir Putin to the presidency. That conflict also propelled Babchenko\'s writing career: He published a memoir about his life as a young soldier, One Soldier\'s War\n\nBut this case has raised serious questions for some about the impact of this hoax on the practice of journalism.\n\n""Babchenko is a journalist, not a policeman ... and part of our job is trust, whatever Trump and Putin say about fake news,"" said Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist and expert on intelligence services, on Twitter. ""I\'m glad he is alive, but he undermined even further the credibility of journalists and the media.""']",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180530155206-02-babchenko-presser-grab-super-tease.jpg

Ukrainian officials offered a jaw-dropping explanation for his so-called death: to expose a Russian plot against him.\n\nTwo people, suspected of being the person who ordered the hit and the potential assassin, are in the custody of the security services, spokeswoman for the Ukraine Prosecutor General, Larisa Sargan, said later Wednesday.\n\nThe elaborate ruse raised many questions. Chief among them, why was it necessary to go to such extraordinary lengths to expose the plot, who was in on it, and what did Olechka Babchenko really see when she found the bleeding body of her husband?\n\nAt the news conference on Wednesday, none of these was addressed.

""I had no choice but to cooperate.""\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, later revealed more details about the alleged plot. According to a statement released by the SBU, Russian special services recruited a Ukrainian citizen -- identified only as ""G"" -- who was tasked with finding, for a payment, perpetrators for a number of high-impact terrorist acts, including the assassination of Babchenko.\n\n""He proposed to his friend, a former member of the ATO in the east of Ukraine, to execute, for $30,000, the contract kill on a Russian journalist, Arkady Babchenko. He has already transferred a deposit of $15,000,"" said Vasyl Hrytsak.\n\nAccording to the SBU, ""G"" also received a dossier on Babchenko with detailed information about his journalistic work and private life, including data on the target himself, his wife, children and parents. Information included phone numbers, bank account details and passport data, the SBU said.\n\n""G"" faces a number of accusations, including aiding in the commitment of a terrorist act and endangering the life or health of a person to violate public safety. A pretrial investigation is underway.\n\nAt times during the news conference, Babchenko seemed emotional.\n\n\'Anti-Russian provocation\'\n\nOnly a day earlier, Ukranian authorities claimed they had launched an investigation into Babchenko\'s death and even released a sketch of the suspected killer.\n\nPolice claimed he was shot in the back and died in an ambulance, citing his friend and supervisor, Ayder Muzhdabaev, deputy general manager of Ukrainian TV channel ATR.

On his official Twitter account, Poroshenko said Ukrainian law enforcement agencies are becoming ""stronger in counteraction to Russian aggression."" He later met Babchenko, embracing the journalist, and posted footage of the encounter on Twitter.\n\nThe affair seemed unlikely to improve the frosty relations between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement , the Russian Foreign Ministry described the operation as ""obviously calculated propaganda"" and ""anti-Russian provocation.""\n\n""We state that the questions of life and death in Ukraine, as well as the international community\'s confidence in Ukraine\'s policy, are nothing more than bargaining chips for the anti-Russian hysteria of the Kiev regime,"" the statement said.\n\nVladimir Dzhabarov, Deputy Chairman of the International Affairs Committee of Russian Federation Council, told state media outlet RIA Novosti that Kiev is now ""disgraced in the eyes of the whole world.""\n\nArkady Babchenko covering unrest in Kiev in 2014.\n\n\'I apologize for what you had to go through\'\n\nDuring the news conference Wednesday, Babchenko thanked the Ukrainian security services for saving his life. He also apologized to his wife and all those who believed he had been killed -- but said the secrecy had been unavoidable.\n\n""I would like to apologize for what you all had to go through ... because I\'ve buried friends and colleagues many times, and I know it\'s a sickening-vomiting feeling when you have to bury your colleagues,"" he said. ""Also I would like to apologize to my wife for the hell she went through in those two days. Olechka, I\'m sorry, but there were no options here, either.""\n\nHe described how he first claimed to have broken his leg and then was requested to ""disappear somewhere"" in the weeks leading up to the staged murder, in a bid to thwart the assassins.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, a journalist and colleague of Babchenko, Simon Ostrovsky, described Wednesday\'s revelation as ""totally shocking and unprecedented.""\n\n""For those of us who know Arkady personally, this is something that we\'re going to have to process for a little while longer,"" he said.\n\nKateryna Lisunova, an acquaintance of Babchenko who works in New York as a special correspondent for Ukrainian television station Pryamiy, was in the ATR newsroom in Kiev to watch the news conference and posted a video on Facebook of people clapping, cheering and jumping as Babchenko appeared.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists, which had earlier decried Babchenko\'s ""murder,"" expressed relief that he was alive but demanded answers from the Ukranian authorities.

Shortly after Babchenko\'s death was announced, Moscow and Kiev began blaming each other for the killing of the journalist, who is a vocal critic of the Kremlin and left Russia in 2017, saying he no longer felt safe.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman implied Russia had orchestrated the ""killing"" of Babchenko, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed that idea and slammed Ukraine as an unsafe place for journalists to work.\n\nOn Wednesday Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the affair was a propaganda exercise by Ukraine, but that she was happy Babchenko was alive.\n\nBabchenko left Russia after he criticized the Kremlin in a Facebook post in 2017.\n\nHe faced backlash after commenting on the crash of a Russian plane transporting the world-famous military choir Alexandrov Ensemble en route to Syria.

Opinion: Staged murder of Russian journalist comes at a heavy price,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/nVFjvFpYgnw/index.html,CNN_World_News,CNN,['Michael Bociurkiw'],,"['Michael Bociurkiw is a writer and development professional who has worked on emergencies on several continents, most recently as a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Without firing a shot or sacrificing a life, the Ukrainian security services have scored a direct propaganda hit against the Kremlin in its staging of the ""murder"" of Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko. But at what cost?\n\nThe unfolding story over the past 24 hours is as shocking as it is bizarre.The journalism community and friends of Babchenko mourned as news of his alleged murder -- by an assailant painted as cowardly for shooting him in the back three times -- was reported Tuesday.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, the 41-year-old Babchenko was paraded at a press conference organized by Ukraine security services. The journalist, who was a prime target for his scathing criticism of the Kremlin, said the Ukrainian authorities approached him a month ago with evidence that his murder was planned for $30,000. ""I understood it had to be an operation of Russian special services. I had no choice but to participate in the sting,"" he told a packed Kiev news conference today.\n\nTwo suspects are in custody and Ukrainian authorities say they\'ve established a link to Russian special forces. To some, the operation was reminiscent of Egypt\'s attempt in 1984 to fake the murder of a leading opponent of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nIn a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said it was glad Babchenko is alive, but called the incident ""another anti-Russian provocation"" and said it was ""obviously designed for a certain propaganda effect.""\n\nThat Babchenko would allow himself to take part in a sting operation, even dupe his close friends and colleagues, to catch his alleged assailant compromises journalists at a time when they are under attack in Ukraine and in many other places around the world.\n\nDo we need another excuse for the media to be branded as fake or manipulative? Kiev authorities said they were made aware of the plot four months ago and staged the elaborate ploy in order to capture suspects. Ukrainian television channel 112 is reporting that a suspect also planned to set up a ""weapons base"" in the Ukrainian capital in order to launch more terrorist attacks.\n\nWrote my friend, journalist Anna Nemtsova: ""No fake news ever shocked reporters working in Russia and Ukraine more than this story.""\n\nWhile expressing relief that Babchenko is alive, many journalists and media watchdogs have come out slamming the operation.\n\nThe global media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders, said , ""it is always dangerous for States to play with the facts, and also on the back of journalists."" And the Committee to Protect Journalists says that it is investigating what it calls ""an unprecedented situation"" -- adding that the Ukrainian authorities need to disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the murder.\n\nOne journalist described the sting as ""a mindless and tragic mistreatment of public empathy that discredits so many things at once -- Ukraine, Russian liberals, journalists. Only the Kremlin wins.""\n\nWhatever the explanation, the operation could have been done in such a way as to not compromise the journalist -- or the news media as a whole.\n\nUkrainian law enforcement has a well-deserved reputation for incompetence, cover-ups and colluding with corrupt oligarchs. Several murder cases -- including that of Pavel Sheremet, a journalist who was killed in broad daylight in Kiev in 2016 -- remain unsolved and not one wanted major figure from the previous administration of Viktor Yanukovych has been placed behind bars. And so the temptation to show a major win in its hybrid war against Russia must have been irresistible. But this sting operation resembled something more like an amateur public relations exercise than a serious counter-intelligence operation.\n\nMoreover, parading Babchenko at a press conference in Kiev plays into the hands of those who accuse the media of being fake or untrustworthy. As we traverse the shoals of a post-truth world it can only further undermine people\'s trust in journalism. Furthermore, the credibility of Ukrainian security officials will suffer in the long term. Anything the Ukrainian Government says henceforth will now have to be double and triple checked.\n\nUkraine\'s beleaguered president, Petro Poroshenko, also needs to answer for what could very well end up being a major strategic communications disaster for his country. With elections next year and his approval ratings in the single digits, he has back-pedaled on internationally-backed reforms designed to break up the state security service, the SBU, into a a leaner organization that is more professional and efficient -- and less prone to corruption.\n\nAt a time when Ukraine is positioning itself as a responsible member of the European community and is begging international donors for assistance in countering ""fake news,"" why would it contribute to its spread?\n\nAs for Babchenko? It could be that the price for his head has significantly increased, and he will likely require round-the-clock protection for the rest of his life. Then again, it is not often that one gets to read what has been written about you after your death.']",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180530190322-01-babchenko-presser-super-tease.jpg

It includes US motorcycles, denim, cigarettes, cranberry juice and peanut butter.\n\nThe trading relationship between the two sides is worth more than $1 trillion annually. The EU exports significantly more goods to the US than the other way around, though their trade in services is fairly even.\n\nThe EU-US talks come just one day after the Trump administration\'s surprise announcement that it would impose tariffs on about $50 billion worth of Chinese goods and restrict Chinese investment in the United States.\n\nThe shock move followed intensive negotiations between both sides, and an agreement to put a hold on threatened tariffs while talks progressed.\n\nRelated: China says it\'s ready to fight back after US revives tariffs\n\nExperts said it\'s exceedingly difficult to forecast the outcome of the US-EU talks.\n\n""The way the United States has dealt with trade policy, it\'s so difficult to predict what will happen,"" said Ross Denton, a trade expert and partner at law firm Baker McKenzie.\n\nDenton said the European Union has a strong case for exemptions from the steel and aluminum tariffs, which were imposed in the name of national security. But the Trump administration may not agree.\n\n""I don\'t see any particular benefit to the Trump administration to, frankly, pissing the European Union off,"" Denton said.\n\nRelated: Why are US cranberries repeatedly threatened with tariffs?\n\nThe American Chamber of Commerce to the European Union -- which represents US companies in the region -- called on the Trump administration to show restraint.\n\n""These [US] tariff proposals could ignite a dangerous escalation in trade disputes and could also have other unintended consequences. They could have significant implications for jobs, growth and security on both sides of the Atlantic,"" it said in a statement.\n\nThe European Union said it would respond in a ""proportionate"" way in order to avoid a trade war. But President Donald Trump may not see it that way.\n\nTrump had previously threatened to respond to any new EU trade barriers with a tax on vehicles made by European carmakers.\n\nRoss has already launched an investigation into whether global automobile imports are hurting US national security. The administration used this same approach before announcing the steel and aluminum tariffs.\n\nA tariff on cars and auto parts would have a damaging impact on American drivers and global automakers.\n\nRelated: Trump\'s on-again, off-again strategy on China may backfire\n\nRelations between the United States and European Union have also been strained over Iran.\n\nEuropean businesses were recently burned by Trump\'s decision to reimpose wide-reaching sanctions on Iran, forcing some to wind down their operations in the country.

Gaur said. The CBI case names Tony Fernandes -- founder and CEO of the Malaysia-based carrier -- among several people accused of wrongdoing.\n\nAirAsia India denied any wrongdoing. Shuva Mandal, a director at the company, said in a statement that the company is ""cooperating with all regulators and agencies to present the correct facts.""\n\nRelated: Analysis: Why no one wants India\'s national airline\n\nIndian police allege that AirAsia India executives used middlemen to funnel bribes to Indian government officials in order to try to secure a license for the airline to operate international flights.\n\nUntil recently, airlines in India were required to have a fleet of 20 aircraft and five years of service in order to fly in and out of the country, conditions which AirAsia India could not meet because it only launched in 2014 and operates 18 planes.\n\nNews of the investigation buffeted AirAsia Group\'s stock, which fell nearly 7% in Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday.\n\n""Investors are concerned that the investigations could reduce or eliminate AirAsia India\'s chances to operate international flights, which is where the goldmine lies,"" said Corrine Png, founder of transportation research firm Crucial Perspective.\n\nRelated: India\'s airports will be at breaking point by 2022\n\nThe CBI case also accuses the airline\'s Indian franchise of breaching the country\'s foreign investment rules.\n\nIndian laws prevent foreign airlines from holding a controlling stake in any local airline.

Now, as food runs out over the next few months, international officials expect that number to grow considerably, with millions potentially facing acute malnutrition.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis year’s harvest was the smallest on record since South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, with the country producing only a fraction of its needs, according to the World Food Program.\n\nOn top of that, peace talks have stalled and cease-fires have largely been ignored, which means the fighting has cut off some areas from emergency help. Aid workers have been targeted by government and rebel fighters alike, making food distribution increasingly difficult.\n\nEven here in the capital, which had been largely immune to the food crisis, many families are finding it impossible to pay the steep prices demanded in the city’s markets, their options vanishing as the currency crashes.\n\nFamilies from across the country pile into a clinic for malnourished children, setting aside the political and ethnic divides that have torn this new nation to shreds. Some mothers come from areas backing the government. Others have husbands, brothers and sons who fight for the rebels.\n\nDozens of the women lie outside on the floor, their children wrapped in blankets. The signs of malnutrition are clear: Swollen bellies and emaciated limbs. Skin hanging in folds from tiny bones. Bodies covered in open sores, the painful result of edema breaking the skin.\n\nPhoto\n\nCecilia Kideen struggled to feed her 9-month-old daughter, Sarah. Her breast milk is not enough, as she barely eats one meal a day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“The mothers,” she said, “are really suffering.”\n\nSouth Sudan, the world’s newest nation, was born from an enormous international push to end decades of conflict between the north and south of what was then Sudan.\n\nBut just two years later, the new country was at war.\n\nIn December 2013, a feud between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar quickly descended into a conflict that has fractured the country, killed tens of thousands of people and decimated what was already one of the world’s least developed nations.\n\n“There are very few populations that are escaping the impacts of hunger,” said Elizabeth White, Oxfam’s South Sudan policy adviser. “But all roads lead back to conflict and insecurity.”\n\nTalks between the government and opposition leaders have been postponed. But even if peace can be reached, the hunger crisis still looms.\n\nFarming on the Front Lines\n\nThe civil war in South Sudan has set off the largest refugee crisis in Africa since the Rwandan genocide, the United Nations says. More than two million people have fled the country, crippling food production. Nearly two million others have abandoned their homes and remain scattered around the country, leaving behind ghost towns and untended fields.\n\nAt the nation’s southern border, dozens of refugees cross a narrow bridge into Uganda each day, bringing stories of hunger with them.\n\nMary Yar, 20, arrived with her 1-year-old son at a small reception center on the Ugandan side. At the site, the first assessment that refugees go through is a malnutrition screening\n\n“There is no food there,” Mrs. Yar said of her home village, pointing back toward the bridge to South Sudan.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring the height of the hunger season last year, South Sudanese arrived by the thousands, said Geoffrey Chandiga, a child assessment officer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe keeps a tally of new arrivals on a whiteboard, noting that officials are bracing for an uptick in the months ahead.\n\nTwo years ago, South Sudan’s war expanded into southern parts of the country that had long been seen as the country’s breadbasket. People flooded across the Ugandan border. Most have yet to return.\n\nWhen United Nations peacekeepers visited the areas in early 2017, they saw entire villages burned to the ground.\n\n$321.70 for a Plate of Beans\n\nUnder a sharp midmorning sun in the capital, Elizabeth Kenyi and her husband, Johnson Ali, plucked vegetables from their garden along the White Nile, a tributary of the Nile.\n\nFor two decades, they have sold their okra, peppers and tomatoes in a nearby market. But even with a plentiful harvest this year, they are finding it harder than ever to feed their family of seven.\n\n“The money that I got from the garden is useless,” Mr. Ali said.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile their produce commands a higher price than it did last year, prices for the staple grains they buy, like maize and sorghum, are climbing fast.\n\nSouth Sudan's currency is in freefall and hyperinflation has squeezed virtually everyone. Before the war, one American dollar was worth about five South Sudanese pounds. By March, a dollar was worth about 220 pounds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe impact has been devastating.

To put it another way, a meal that would cost a New Yorker just $1.20 would cost someone in Juba the equivalent of $321.70.\n\nAwaiting Aid That Can’t Be Delivered\n\nWith agriculture in tatters, emergency aid is keeping a growing share of the country alive.\n\nBy early 2018, half of South Sudan’s population relied on food aid, according to the United Nations, and the percentage will grow as the hunger season reaches its peak in the coming weeks.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut delivering that aid is another matter entirely. The rainy season hits during these lean months, too, turning many roads into rivers of impassable mud.\n\nBeyond that, at least 100 humanitarian workers have been killed here since the start of the conflict, 30 in the last year alone, targeted by warring parties that think the efforts are helping their enemies.\n\nEven within the protected camps set up around the country by the United Nations, there is not enough food to go around.\n\nMrs. Chok, the woman who boiled leaves for her children, had been at a protected area in Juba for a month. The camps sprang up in 2013 as ethnic minorities who feared violence from government forces and their supporters fled to the base of the United Nations peacekeeping mission. Many stayed, and the camps have sprawled into makeshift cities ringed by barbed-wire fences.\n\nThe United Nations provides food to registered camp residents, but thousands inside have no official status, so they rely on their neighbors for food. The rations are simply not enough.\n\nAid workers say that so much of the country is on the move — with vast numbers of people fleeing places where violence erupts — that most new arrivals to Mrs. Chok’s camp have not been registered in more than a year. That means she and countless others receive nothing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaying in the camps is dangerous enough. Attacks and sexual abuse by camp officers have been widely reported. Other accounts have emerged of women trading sex for food. But leaving the camp brings an entirely new set of risks.\n\nPhoto\n\nTafisa Nyattie, 30, who has lived in a camp here since 2013, has six children. Her food rations regularly run out, so she leaves the camp daily to gather firewood, hoping to earn enough money for milk and soap to wash her children’s clothes.\n\nShe walks up to three hours in each direction, braving threats from government forces before returning with a large bundle of wood on her head.\n\n“They will rape you or beat you, and sometimes they kill you,” Mrs. Nyattie said, recounting the well-documented dangers women have faced in the conflict. “Some government soldiers tried to rape me.”\n\nOn another day, she said, she was beaten and her leg was badly injured. But when she saw how hungry her children were, she decided she had no choice but to head back out again.\n\n“You just go, and you don’t know if you will come back to your children,” Mrs. Nyattie said.\n\nHunger’s Youngest Victims\n\nThe malnutrition clinic offers a chilling glimpse of what this hunger season may hold.\n\nThe hospital ward, frequently dark because of intermittent electricity, is treating nearly a dozen more children each day than it did this time last year. They come from around the country to be weighed, measured and given antibiotics and a milk formula before moving on to Plumpy’Nut, a peanut-based nutritional paste — if their bodies can handle it.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the families here are not even victims of the horrors that have chased millions from their homes. Some have jobs, career plans and families to lean on — yet their children are still going hungry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSelwa Anania, a restaurant worker from Juba, brought her 2-year-old son, Taban Zacharia, to the clinic. Her small salary does not go far in the market. Most days, it is only enough for a single meal of porridge.\n\nSylvia George, 27, fanned her son, Mandela Bisa, 2, who lay half-conscious on a bed, hooked up to an intravenous drip. The child’s father is a student at Juba University, and the three live with Ms. George’s mother, whom they rely on for food. There is never enough.\n\nFor now, with the peak of the hunger season still weeks away, the clinic manages the steady flow of patients, said Josephin Ruben, the head nutritionist.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut, she noted anxiously, there “will not be enough when we get to June and July.”""]",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/world/xxsouthsudan-hunger-09/xxsouthsudan-hunger-09-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg

It was a time when unwanted pregnancy carried so much social stigma that many young women and their parents went to great lengths to conceal it.\n\nMany smaller institutions were also involved in arranging adoptions, with little or no supervision. As they closed, their files were handed over to the government’s child protection agency, Tusla.\n\nTusla took over the St Patrick’s Guild files in 2016 and discovered, while attempting to help adopted children trace their birth parents, that some of the births had been fraudulently registered.

Human rights groups say the lack of accountability is particularly jarring, arguing that the attacks on the Rohingya involve exactly the kind of mass atrocities this court was created for. Its mandate is to judge crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.\n\nAn obvious obstacle is that Myanmar, where the violence was meted out, is not a signatory to the court. That means the court cannot address crimes committed in Myanmar, by Myanmar citizens, unless the United Nations Security Council authorizes it, which most observers say is unlikely.\n\nAnd Myanmar has shown little interest in punishing those responsible or pursuing the evidence, which has been documented by rights groups and journalists and corroborated by satellite imagery.\n\nSo prosecutors and human rights lawyers are trying a novel approach: They argue that since hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have been deported to Bangladesh, and since this can be construed as continuing crimes against humanity taking place in Bangladesh, a member of the court, the prosecutor can have jurisdiction to act. Bangladesh is not suspected of crimes, but would provide the route to jurisdiction.\n\nThe request submitted on Wednesday by the group Shanti Mohila, or Peace Women, goes further: Its lawyers say that as long as Myanmar refuses the return of the Rohingya and forces them to live in terrible conditions, its “crimes of apartheid, persecution and genocide continue” even outside its territory.

Secretary of state Mike Pompeo's in-person impressions and Trump's gut feelings could be keys in the possible nuclear summit,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/TPgqjnSOI5M/index.html,CNN_Top_Stories,CNN,"['Zachary Cohen', 'Barbara Starr', 'Jenna Mclaughlin']",,"['Washington (CNN) While Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\'s recent meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were billed primarily as diplomatic missions, the face-to-face encounters have also served as valuable intelligence gathering opportunities that are helping shape US officials\' understanding of the reclusive dictator and guide ongoing talks between the two countries.\n\nA series of constantly updated US intelligence assessments have determined that Kim will come to the negotiating table with his own red lines revolving around a single calculation: How much, if any, of his nuclear weapons program does he give up while still assuring the survival of his regime and his singular position in power?\n\nThese intelligence assessments, largely led by the CIA\'s Korea Mission Center, are examining all issues that could impact Kim\'s thinking and approach to the negotiations, including the impact of US-backed economic development how Kim can maintain the loyalty of his top military commanders. The issue of Kim\'s concern for his safety and survival was even addressed by President Donald Trump in public comments when he guaranteed the Kim\'s safety if he agreed to denuclearize.\n\nThe US intelligence community has been working to understand what makes Kim tick since he took power in 2011 -- gathering details related to his psychological makeup, leadership style and personality in order to support the policymakers tasked with dealing with North Korea\'s nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnd that effort has only been amplified in recent weeks as US officials continue to lay the groundwork for on-again, off-again talks between Kim and Trump in Singapore on June 12.\n\nDespite Trump\'s threat last week to call off the summit , the White House has indicated that preparations are still under way.\n\nRepresentatives from Washington and Pyongyang have been dispatched in recent days to conduct various meetings, and in his most significant gesture so far, Kim has sent his former intelligence chief and close confidante Kim Yong Chol to New York to meet with Pompeo.\n\nEven after Trump made his cancellation announcement, Pompeo has continued to work on preparations for a potential summit. Defense Secretary James Mattis has also continued to publicly emphasize diplomacy led by Pompeo.\n\nThose familiar with Pompeo\'s thinking have said that his meeting with Chol will set some of the terms and agenda for a potential summit -- but most importantly Pompeo loyalists believe the meeting is a sign that he is the senior US official, short of the President, that Kim is willing to work with.\n\nIf Pompeo is included at the summit table, his role will include ensuring both Kim and Trump keep to the agenda and do not get unduly distracted by their rhetoric, one US official said.\n\n""Secretary Pompeo has spent more time with the \'living God\' than any other American ... {Kim} has been sheltered from foreign view very deliberately up until now,"" Nick Eberstadt, American Enterprise Institute scholar and adviser to National Bureau of Asian Research, told CNN.\n\nWhile sources have relayed various rumors about Kim to intelligence officials over the years, Eberstadt said the US can be most confident in assessments regarding North Korea\'s ""objectives because those haven\'t really changed between three generations of Kims.""\n\nOn the same page?\n\nWhile US intelligence officials have determined Kim is unlikely to completely surrender his nuclear program as part of a negotiation with the US, Trump has laid out a red line of his own -- saying any summit must include a guarantee that North Korea\'s weapons can no longer threaten the US or its allies.\n\nBut a series of US intelligence assessments have concluded that while Kim could give up some weapons including warheads and missiles, he may not be willing to give up his capabilities to regenerate his program.\n\nThat would include keeping scientific, engineering and technical capabilities and personnel which would be seen by Kim as his insurance policy to ensure he could stay in power, officials said.\n\n""He is not going to do anything that allows him to become vulnerable,"" one official told CNN. He also could decide to keep some hidden weapons inventories, officials acknowledged.\n\nSo far, US officials say, the Kim regime hasn\'t taken any steps on denuclearization that could not be readily reversed. They said the May 24 destruction of underground tunnels to test nuclear devices was a ""serious gesture."" But it ""doesn\'t foreclose further testing"" at other locations, one official said.\n\nUS satellite imagery recorded technical equipment and gear being removed from the site prior to the destruction of the tunnels, three US defense officials say. ""They are not going to give up anything valuable,"" one official said.\n\nIn addition the US has preliminarily identified other potential sites where the North Koreans could dig new underground tunnels for testing.\n\nKim a \'rational actor\' with his position largely set\n\nIntelligence assessments have concluded that Kim is coming to the table with his position largely set with regards to what he will give up and what he plans to retain or possibly hide away.\n\nIt\'s not clear what security guarantees the US could give Kim that would convince him to give up his entire program, including those scientific, engineering and technical capabilities including underground sites that could shield key items.\n\nThat idea is largely supported by the US intelligence community\'s assessment that Kim is a ""rational actor"" motivated by the survival of his own regime.\n\nPompeo, who took a leading role on the North Korea issue even before he was confirmed as secretary of state, has had direct contact with Kim on two occasions -- providing unique insight into the isolated leader\'s personal makeup that also supports the latest findings from the intelligence community.\n\n""My personal view is that the assessment hasn\'t changed: he\'s a rational actor who has consolidated power; he\'s in control,"" said Ambassador Joseph R. DeTrani, who previously served at the Department of State as the special envoy for Six-Party Talks with North Korea.\n\nA former intelligence official specializing in Asia who maintains contact with current officials told CNN: ""I\'m sure [CIA] would stick by the line that Kim just wants to die peacefully of old age.""\n\nThe CIA did not respond to CNN\'s request for a comment.\n\nBut Pompeo himself has said that the meeting not only supported the intelligence community\'s existing assessment, but that Kim\'s behavior indicated he was sincere about pursuing a path toward denuclearization.\n\n""I did get a sense that he was serious,"" Pompeo said.\n\n""The economic pressure that has been put in place by this global effort that President Trump has led has led him to believe that it is in his best interests to come to the table and talk about denuclearization,"" he added.\n\nCurrently the highest-ranking US administration official to meet with Kim, Pompeo\'s observations support the idea that Kim is not irrational or crazy -- an image that has been perpetuated at times by the media, some lawmakers and even President Trump himself, according to Bruce Klingner, a former deputy division chief for Korea at the CIA who\'s now a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation\n\n""He was painted as someone who the US could not count on to not start a war,"" Klingner said. ""We are seeing some of that now as people realize that Kim, contrary to perception, is not crazy or irrational.""\n\nValue of direct contact\n\nNorth Korea\'s history of isolation has traditionally forced US intelligence agencies to utilize second-hand information gathered through interviews with individuals who have had direct contact Kim during his life.\n\nAnalysts try to put together a profile of a leader based on readouts from people who have met with them and reading about them to get a sense of their psychology and how they make decisions, Klingner said.\n\nWith an isolated leader like Kim, intelligence is rarely collected directly from the source, making Pompeo\'s contact so valuable.\n\n""Having Pompeo in a room with Kim provides direct contact and offers insight into Kim\'s mannerisms, how capable he is as a leader, and how much he relies on others,"" according to Klingner.\n\n""Having direct access to someone should provide a lot better insight,"" he said.\n\nPompeo is not specifically trained to interpret body language indicators or other subtle details that may have presented themselves in these meetings, but he was accompanied by intelligence officials who were taking note of these cues, a source familiar told CNN.\n\nTwo US officials have told CNN that Kim was very straightforward, professional, calm and on top of his brief in his meeting with Pompeo, adding that he knew and could discuss the issues in detail.\n\nAnd one source briefed on the matter told CNN that it was clear to Pompeo that Kim understands how to present himself as a fairly normal politician.\n\nBut while those who meet with Kim often determine he is not necessarily insane, Klingner warned that the difference between those misconceptions and the impression Kim gives off in person can also lead to an overreaction.\n\n""When someone meets with Kim, they often come back sort of in awe -- realizing that he is not the crazy guy in the basement -- and with the conclusion that the US can deal with him,"" he said.\n\n""But due to the fact that they often go into the meeting with a misconception of Kim based on caricatures from outside intelligence community, the perceptions often shifts from one extreme to another,"" he added.\n\nPompeo, however, has expressed a sense of cautious optimism about Kim\'s intentions.\n\nEven after Trump threatened to cancel the scheduled summit last week, Pompeo said he was ""hopeful"" discussions could get back on track, adding there was ""little doubt"" in his mind that Kim understood the scope of what the US was asking for with regards to the permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nHe has also cautioned that North Korea has made and broken promises in the past.\n\n""President Trump has made clear we are going to work to get a meeting set up, the two of them will meet. In the event it fails, respectfully, President Trump will walk away and the pressure will remain but in the event we reach a resolution it would be a wonderful thing for the world,"" Pompeo said last week after Trump threatened to cancel the summit.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the situation told CNN that while some progress has already been made to this point, there is still a general understanding within the administration that the North Korean regime remains unpredictable -- as it has been for decades.\n\nAnd despite Pompeo\'s assurances that he believes Kim is serious about wanting to negotiate, some within the administration remain deeply skeptical about North Korea\'s intentions -- specifically their willingness to give up their nuclear weapons, the source said.\n\nTrump the wild card\n\nIt remains unclear as to how Trump is personally preparing for the potential sitdown with Kim, but he has told advisers he\'s confident in his ability to sway the North Korean leader in person.\n\nBut the President\'s push for a face-to-face meeting with Kim is raising concerns that he may disregard the vast intelligence resources provided on Kim in favor of leaning on his own instincts.\n\nAn intelligence profile of Kim is provided for Trump in his daily briefing, according to DeTrani, but it remains unclear as to whether the President regularly reads intelligence reports provided to him.\n\n""That profile includes intelligence related to Kim\'s personality, negotiation tactics, personal history and potential weaknesses so that the President might be able to anticipate certain moves once they are in the same room,"" DeTrani said.\n\nUltimately, intelligence analysts are trying to enable policymakers to make the most informed decisions possible, but ""at the end of the day, you can lead a horse to water but you can\'t force someone to read the briefing,"" according to Klingner.\n\n""Trump has thrown out the usual diplomatic playbook and the concept of bureaucratic timelines,"" Klingner said. ""Traditionally, the US would not deploy a president to negotiate terms but to sign the agreement once the details were in place.""\n\n""Trump doing the opposite, implementing a top-down approach,"" he added.

We are looking for something that has never been done before,"" said the official.\n\nWhat precisely that means remains unclear, but the North Korean regime has historically shown an unwillingness to relinquish its nuclear capabilities, which it views as a guarantee of survival.\n\nAccording to the official, Pompeo\'s meeting is part of a renewed effort by the US to convince North Korean officials that denuclearization will result in a ""brighter future"" for their country.\n\nPreviously, the US has floated the idea of providing the North with economic assistance and sanctions relief should it agree to a timetable for abandoning its nuclear weapons program.\n\n\'We will be ready\'\n\nPrior to Kim\'s arrival in New York, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that the Trump administration was still aiming for a June 12 summit meeting.\n\nReferring to denuclearization, Sanders said that, ""as long as that is part of the discussion, we\'re going to focus on the June 12"" date.\n\n""We are preparing and expect that to take place on June 12 and if not,"" she said, ""we\'ll be ready on July 12.""\n\nThe high-level meeting was intended to help convince the North Korean delegation that denuclearization will result in a ""brighter future.""\n\nPompeo and Kim\'s high-level meeting comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nOver the weekend, Kim Jong Un called an impromptu second meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In at the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries and reiterated his apparent commitment to denuclearization.\n\nThis was followed Monday by preparatory summit talks between US diplomats and North Korean officials, also at the Demilitarized Zone.\n\nThe official dinner menu featured traditional American staples such as beef and corn.\n\nOn Wednesday a source familiar with US-North Korean relations revealed that the visiting US delegation, led by Philippines Ambassador Sung Kim, had extended its stay ""for at least another day.""\n\nMeanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in Pyongyang Thursday for meetings with his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho.\n\nLavrov is the latest in a string of high-level meetings staged by North Korea following years of isolation, as it looks to build alliances and strengthen its negotiating position ahead of the possible June 12 summit.\n\nEarlier this month, Kim Jong Un traveled to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the second meeting between the two leaders since March.\n\nNorth Korean diplomat Kim Yong Chol shakes hands with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nAbout turn\n\nWednesday\'s meeting between Pompeo and Kim represents a remarkable turn-around given that the talks nearly fell apart last week when Trump said he was calling off the June 12 meeting in Singapore.\n\nThe White House said in a background briefing that North Korean officials hadn\'t answered their calls, frustrating their attempts to plan for the meeting.\n\nBut they also complained about a senior North Korean foreign ministry official\'s comments after he dismissed Vice President Mike Pence as a ""political dummy.""\n\nPence had drawn a comparison between the administration\'s hopes for North Korea and the ""Libya model,"" which could be a reference to starkly different things. It could be read as a way for the country to divest itself of nuclear weapons, or seen as a reference to the overthrowing and killing of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nKim Yong Chol is a powerful surrogate for Kim Jong Un. The vice chairman of North Korea\'s Party Central Committee, he is the top official in charge of relations between North and South Korea and has been present in all recent high-level meetings with South Korea.\n\nHe is also a former head of North Korea\'s Reconnaissance Bureau, an espionage and special operations organization. He is believed to have been involved in a torpedo attack that sank the South Korean warship Cheonan in 2010, killing 46 South Korean sailors.\n\nClarification: This article has been updated to clarify a US delegation is staying in South Korea for at least an extra day.

And wouldn\'t you know it, Jesus has real nice taste in planes.\n\nJesse Duplantis, leader of Jesse Duplantis Ministries and the owner of three other private jets, is asking his followers to chip in so his ministry can purchase a brand new Dassault Falcon 7X , which runs about $54 million.\n\nIn a video recently published on his website , Duplantis says the planes get him closer to the Lord -- both literally and figuratively -- and he had a divine conversation in which Jesus asked for the new aircraft by name.\n\n""It was one of the greatest statements the Lord ever told me, he said, \'Jesse do you want to come up where I\'m at?\'"" the minister says. ""\'I want you to bleed me for a Falcon 7X.\'""\n\nBy ""bleed,"" Duplantis -- er, Jesus -- apparently meant ""ask for donations.""\n\nDuplantis goes on to tell his followers that jets, especially nice ones with good fuel efficiency, allow him and his ministries to reach more people around the world. And no, it wouldn\'t technically be his, it would be the ministry\'s.\n\n""All it\'s gonna do is it\'s going to touch people, it\'s going to reach people, it\'s going to change lives one soul at a time,"" Duplantis said of the aircraft.\n\n""I really believe that if Jesus was physically on the earth today, he wouldn\'t be riding a donkey,"" he added with a chuckle.\n\nIn the video, Duplantis also shows his followers a photo of him standing beside his other three jets: a Cessna Citation 500, an IAI Westwind II, and a Dassault Falcon 50. Under the portrait is a quote, which he proudly reiterates: ""It\'s not about possessions, it\'s about priorities.""\n\nDuplantis shows his followers a photo of him standing with his other three jets.\n\nCNN has reached out to Duplantis for comment.\n\nOn its website Dassault boasts that the Falcon 7X combines ""fighter jet technology with an elegant, whisper-quiet executive cabin.""\n\nIf this all seems a little spendy, you may not be familiar with the concepts behind prosperity theology. According to prosperity gospel preachers and believers, nice things like jets and cars and rent money are God\'s way of blessing people for a faithful life. And by their logic sharing your wealth with the church will make God bless you even more.\n\nIt\'s maybe no surprise then that big-name prosperity gospel preachers have a thing for jets. To them, such luxury is not at odds with Jesus\' teachings of moderation and humility.\n\nAnd Duplantis is not the only preacher claiming to be having conversations with the Almighty about mid-range business aircraft.\n\nEarlier this year, prosperity preacher Kenneth Copeland acquired a Gulfstream V jet from director Tyler Perry , paid for by donations from his followers.\n\nCopeland and Duplantis also discussed the necessity of private jets on a 2016 episode of Copeland\'s show , ""Believer\'s Voice of Victory,"" during which Copeland described commercial air travel as being ""in a long tube with a bunch of demons.""\n\n""The world is in such shape, we can\'t get [to followers] without [private jets]. We\'ve got to have them,"" Copeland said.\n\nCopeland noted that famed evangelical pastor Oral Roberts flew commercial, but the people on the planes ""agitated his spirit"" with their requests for prayers.\n\n""You can\'t manage that today,"" he said.']",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180530123853-jesse-duplantis-plane-super-tease.jpg

"Why divorce is bad for your health (like, really bad)",http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B47D55810-643B-11E8-AAA9-EC0FA6EDB264%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1,MarketWatch_Top_Stories,MarketWatch,['Maria Lamagna'],,"['We already know divorce can be bad for your check book and your emotional health. It turns out, it can be bad for your physical health, too.\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine, an academic journal, suggests people who divorce have a greater likelihood of smoking and lower amounts of physical activity.\n\nResearchers at the University of Arizona studied more than 5,700 people, using the English Longitudinal Study of Aging, a long-term health study of adults over 50 in the U.K. There are seven sets of data in the study, collected every two years, beginning in 2002. Some 900 of the study participants were divorced or separated and had not remarried. The rest were married.\n\nThey reported their life satisfaction, their exercise frequency, smoking status and measurements of their lung function and levels of inflammation. Those who were divorced or separated had a 46% greater risk of dying during the study than their counterparts who were still married. (The researchers controlled for factors like gender, health, age and socioeconomic status.)\n\nWhy the deterioration in divorcees’ health? Divorced or separated participants, especially women, were less satisfied with life than their married counterparts in the study, the researchers found. That creates an unhealthy and potentially fatal spiral: Lower satisfaction with life was also linked to lower levels of physical activity and lower levels of physical activity is linked to greater risk for an early death.\n\nThat said, not all marriages are the same, and it’s important to distinguish between healthy, happy ones and toxic ones, that might be impacting one or both partners’ health negatively, said Jennifer Behnke, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Juno Beach, Fla. “In a miserable relationship, you’re sitting on the couch, watching TV, feeling that toxicity of resentment and not getting your needs met,” she said.\n\nBut this isn’t the first study that has shown a link between divorce and a negative impact on health. A 2009 study from researchers at the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins University found that divorced or widowed people have 20% more chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer, than married people.\n\nDivorced or widowed people also have 23% more mobility limitations than married people, such as trouble climbing stairs or walking one block. People who never married have about the same number of chronic health conditions as married people. But they do report 13% more depressive symptoms and 12% more mobility limitations than people who are married.\n\nHealthier partners might actually help their spouse stay healthier, too, Bourassa said. “If you imagine a husband or wife who doesn’t smoke and their partner does, one might try to influence the other’s behavior. In many ways, when relationships end, we lose that important social control of our health behaviors.”\n\nStill, divorce doesn’t have to lead to poor health outcomes, the researchers of the latest study said. Quality of life can actually improve for people who have ended relationships that are unhealthy for them. In fact, right after a divorce, individuals will often hit the gym even more, as they re-enter the dating world, Behnke said.\n\n“It’s called a ‘revenge body’ for a reason.”\n\nBut smoking and exercise could be important factors to watch in divorcees, Bourassa said. “If we know someone who is divorced, maybe we should ask, ‘Are you smoking? Are you getting enough physical activity?’” he said.']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK089_MLDivo_ZG_20180530151115.jpg

"The Moneyist: My husband has terrible credit, so I’m buying a house alone—but I want pullout beds for his kids",http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BD5BCB690-57B7-11E8-B7AB-A385A57510A8%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1,MarketWatch_Top_Stories,MarketWatch,"['Quentin Fottrell', 'Personal Finance Editor']",,"['Dear Moneyist,\n\nFor years, my husband and I talked about purchasing a home. I have excellent credit. However, his credit is terrible. We have had several discussions about paying off his debts and putting us in a better position to purchase the home.\n\nWhile going through the process of purchasing a home, I discovered that he had outstanding bills and he did not pay off his $10,000 IRS tax debt that he incurred prior to us getting married. After consulting several lenders, no one will let us purchase a home together. The only way we can purchase a home is if I do it alone.\n\nI am perfectly fine with this. The problem is that he has two children — one girl and one boy — from a previous marriage and he wants them to have a room at our house. They reside with their mother in another state and visit us for the summer and the Christmas break. We have a child together and as we are still in our 30s, we are planning to have another.\n\nAlso see: My fiancé postponed our wedding, secretly bought a house—and told me I could pay rent\n\nBecause the house is being purchased with my name and on my salary alone, I can only qualify for a smaller mortgage than we had originally anticipated. I want a nicer, newer house with three bedrooms. He wants a much older home that needs a lot of updating, but will have enough rooms to accommodate his children.\n\nWe can’t seem to agree. Since he did not take care of his part, I do not feel like I should compromise by living in an older home that I will not be happy in just so they can have their own room. In fact, I feel that the final decision is mine because I have to sign for everything.\n\nHe ignores the fact that his debt is the reason why we are in this position, and he is only concerned about making his kids feel welcome when they come to visit (they are his words). We have to two pull out beds for guests to sleep on, so it’s not like they are sleeping on the floor.\n\nHow can we resolve this issue? I don’t want to spend any extra money than I have to or put us in a financial bind, yet he refuses to compromise on anything.\n\nDeadlocked in Indiana\n\nDear Deadlocked,\n\nOften times, the clue is in the question. Or the headline. In this case, the clue is in your sobriquet. “Deadlocked” says all you need to know. You can’t go forward. At least, not to buy a house. You can’t agree on the size and type, and it’s an unequal conversation because you are putting your good credit and name on the line, not your that of your husband. So it’s easy for him to call the shots when he is taking none of the risk.\n\nThe other problem: Given that he has a list of existing bad debts, which he did not disclose to you, there is a significant trust issue here. He needs to pay off his debt to the Internal Revenue Service, and any other unpaid bills, before you buy a house as a married couple — even if your name is the only one on the mortgage and the deed. There is a breach of trust with you as well as a breach of his pledge to repay this debt with the lenders.\n\nDon’t miss: We plundered our 401(k) to invest in a friend’s business — now we fear it’s a Ponzi scheme\n\nGood credit matters. Over the lifetime of a 30-year mortgage, a buyer with a fair credit score can end up spending $21,000 more than a buyer with an excellent credit score for the typical U.S. home, according to a report released by real-estate website Zillow Z, +5.22% on Tuesday. In San Jose, which has a median home value of $1.3 million, a buyer with the lower credit score can end up paying $129,000 more than a buyer with an excellent credit score over that 30 years.\n\nThe final decision is yours. I agree 100% with that. Your money. Your credit rating. Your name on the mortgage. But that won’t make for a happy life together in this new house, or a happy marriage. It will also cause more resentment every summer and Christmas — a time of year that requires no extra family pressure — when his two children come to stay. Your romance and finances should be on solid ground before you buy, or have another child.\n\nThat means: No new house. Not this year, anyway. Credit scores factor into relationships more than you would think. Americans are still nursing their wounds from the Great Recession and want to find a partner who shares the same financial values. Some 42% of adults say knowing someone’s credit score would affect their willingness to date that person. So please don’t feel guilty about pulling out on what could be the biggest investment of your life.\n\nAlso see: My sister wrote $10,000 checks from our late mother’s bank account—what can I do?\n\nOne member of the Moneyist Facebook Group suggests this as a compromise: “I’m willing to help buy a bigger house that can accommodate your kids, but I need you to help with that. If you can pay off your IRS liens and fix your credit in the next 12 months, we’ll get the bigger house. If not, we’ll move forward on buying the smaller house, and when you have your credit fixed, we can always look at trading up. Deal?” If I were him, I’d take it.\n\nPostcript: I’m not against pullout beds, per se. Murphy beds can be both convertible and save space, and could be easy solution for turning a den into a bedroom during the holidays, especially if his children aren’t living with you full time. In the meantime, figure out what caused your husband to rack up so many debts. And consider seeing a couple’s therapist to get to the bottom of why your husband kept this information from you. That way, you can prevent the same thing from happening again.\n\nDon’t miss: I have terminal cancer. Will my elderly mother be responsible for my credit-card debt?\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

The addition was first announced in April and went live on Tuesday across the U.S. Users can now find the emergency button by swiping up on the center icon and tapping “911 assistance.” After confirming the call, they will be patched through to emergency dispatchers.\n\n“Every second counts in an emergency,” Sachin Kansal, Uber’s director of safety products told MarketWatch in a statement. “We want to make sure our users get help quickly with accurate information if faced with an emergency situation.”\n\nIn some test locations the panic button will share user location directly with 911 operators, including Denver, Colorado; Charleston, South Carolina; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Naples, Florida; and Louisville, Kentucky. Uber hopes to soon make it available everywhere, Kansal said.\n\nThe vast majority of emergencies in Uber rides are related to road accidents, a spokeswoman told MarketWatch. But the new panic button could also be used in cases of sexual assault perpetrated by drivers, an issue that has been brought to light by a number of high-profile cases.\n\nA CNN investigation released last April found at least 103 Uber drivers have been accused of sexual assault in the past four years.\n\n“Sexual assault is a horrible crime that has no place anywhere,” an Uber spokesperson told CNN after that report was released. “While Uber is not immune to this societal issue, we want to be part of the solution to end this violence forever.”\n\nIn a statement to MarketWatch, a spokeswoman for Uber said it has “strengthened driver screenings by committing to proactively re-run criminal background and motor vehicle checks each year.” It cited a statement released in May 2018.\n\nActress Pamela Anderson previously released a series of public service announcements in partnership with organizations PAVE, a nonprofit fighting violence against women, and Ride Responsibly, an initiative by the National Limousine Association, which clearly has a vested interest against other ride-sharing apps, calling on ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft to strengthen background checks on drivers.\n\nAnd a lawsuit filed last November by two unnamed women claimed Uber systematically created an unsafe environment for female passengers. The lawsuit sought class-action status on behalf of all U.S. passengers who were “subject to rape, sexual assault or gender-motivated violence or harassment by their Uber driver in the last four years.”\n\nIn May, Uber ended mandatory arbitration policies for claims of sexual harassment and assault. Riders who alleged that they were sexually assaulted by their drivers no longer had to agree to confidentiality as a condition of their settlement. Lyft, an Uber competitor, announced similar changes.\n\nFollowing the new policies, the company said survivors can seek justice however they choose — except by banding together in a class-action lawsuit.\n\nBut Jeanne Christensen, attorney at Wigdor LLP, the New York-based law firm behind the class-action lawsuit issued in 2017, told CNN, “That’s for the court to decide — not Uber.”\n\nIn an April blog post, Uber’s chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is “getting serious” about safety. “Technology can make travel safer than ever before,” he said. “And while there’s been a lot of progress, we’re committed to doing more.”']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FL173_NA_ube_ZG_20170425171446.jpg

Roseanne Barr discovered that one bad tweet can upend your life — she’s not alone,http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B5B33BDF8-640D-11E8-AD5D-DBD489DC588D%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1,MarketWatch_Top_Stories,MarketWatch,"['Quentin Fottrell', 'Personal Finance Editor']",,"['If you use Twitter, you too are a public figure. And one egregious tweet could blow up your life.\n\nOn Tuesday, ABC DIS, +0.29% cancelled the wildly successful reboot of “Roseanne” after Roseanne Barr wrote a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former adviser in Barack Obama’s White House. Barr apologized, but the damage was done. Several members of her cast and ABC executives denounced her.\n\nThe cancelation of Barr’s show came some 11 hours after she sent the original tweet. “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,” Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment, who is black, said in a statement. ICM Partners talent agency also dropped Barr.\n\nThe political climate puts all employers on high alert when it comes to the words and behavior of their employees.\n\nThe swiftness of ABC’s response is a testament to diversity in the C-suite and the speed with which news travels on social media, says Aram Sinnreich, professor of communications at the American University, Washington, D.C.\n\n“It helps that there’s an African-American woman calling the shots,” he said. “It also reflects that, in the Trump age, the news cycle has accelerated so quickly that there’s a vanishingly small window for commercial entities to get out in front of these damaging public relations incidents. The ability to bury these kinds of stories has diminished to almost zero.”\n\nRead also: 50 million American households can’t even afford basic living expenses\n\nThis wasn’t Barr’s first racist tweet. So why now? The political climate is putting all employers on high alert when it comes to the words and behavior of their employees, Sinnreich says. “We’re understood to be private citizens, but when someone is the public face of a public corporation, that corporation should and must be held accountable for the actions of that individual,” he added.\n\nSinnreich says some people are frustrated with the lack of consequences when President Trump tweets racially-tinged comments. “Until the president is held accountable for the outrageous volume of hate speech that he generates, proxies are going to continue to come under the gun.” (President Trump has made incendiary remarks about Mexicans, Haitians and Nigerians.)\n\nAlso see: Why millions of Americans are lonely\n\nWorkers are plugged into the news cycle. That does not mean you should share all your opinions on social media.\n\nMany people are plugged into the news cycle all day long. One in five employers think staff is productive fewer than five hours a day, with most citing smartphone use as the culprit, a 2016 CareerBuilder report of hiring managers found.\n\nThat does not, however, mean you should share all your opinions on social media. The First Amendment protects free speech, but it may not protect your job if you do or say anything that is contrary to the company’s values, even if it’s a joke. In employment-at-will states, employees without a contract can be fired without cause.\n\n“Twitter is today’s PR Newswire,” says Donna Francavilla, a communications specialist in Birmingham, Ala. “We think we’re talking to our followers and we think they’re all loyal to us and, if we issue an opinion, they’ll agree.” That’s not the case, she said. Often times, many people who follow Trump, for instance, may disagree with his views.\n\n“It never used to be that way,” Francavilla said. “Social media used to be just you and your friends. But we’re now using this new megaphone to express our ideas to a much larger audience.” Anyone with a public Twitter account is a de facto public figure, she added. “We have to be mindful of every word we speak and everything we write.”\n\nThere have been some infamous cases. In December 2013, Justine Sacco, a PR executive for InterActiveCorp, IAC, +1.98% which runs dating websites Match.com and OkCupid, was fired after tweeting offensive comments about AIDS in Africa, before stepping on a plane to go there. Her tweet went viral while she was on the long-distance flight.\n\nIAC said at the time: “The offensive comment doesn’t reflect the views and values of IAC.” Sacco later apologized “for being insensitive to this crisis,” and later said the tweet was intended to be satirical. She left IAC in January 2014 and returned in January 2018 as vice president of communications at Match Group.\n\nThere have been some infamous cases of people being fired for tweeting, even when they said it was satire.\n\nAnthony Weiner, the former Democratic congressman for New York, last year began a 21-month prison sentence for sexting with a minor. But he first resigned in June 2011 after sending a sexually explicit photo of himself to a college student over Twitter.\n\nAt first, Weiner claimed that his account was hacked. While he lost his $174,000-a-year job — the standard salary for members of the House and the Senate — he walked away with the equivalent of around $1.2 million in retirement benefits after just a dozen years in office. He later expressed remorse: “These destructive impulses brought great devastation to family and friends, and destroyed my life’s dream of public service,” he said.\n\nDon’t miss: Ambien maker responds to Roseanne: Racism is ‘not a known side effect’\n\nEven posting photographs or retweeting someone else’s tweet can be enough to get fired. Despite repeated warnings, people still get fired for sending an inappropriate photo or tweet. The problem with sites like Twitter and Instagram is that immediacy and informality are also social media’s greatest dangers, experts say.\n\nAnd in many cases, there’s no turning back once you hit “send” and there are plenty of reasons not to. Case in point: Five workers on a dam in Oroville, Calif., were fired earlier this year for taking photos of the dam and posting them on Instagram despite a strict no social media and no photos policy at the site.\n\nAlso see: How America has changed since ‘Roseanne’ premiered in 1988\n\nEmployees often say their opinions do not reflect those of their company, but sometimes even that’s not enough.\n\nFor corporate America, the power of Twitter TWTR, +0.94% can work both ways. In February, Kylie Jenner, start of E!’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” and a fashion empire mogul in her own right, tweeted that she was over Snapchat SNAP, +3.98%\n\n“Sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad,” Jenner tweeted to her 25.5 million Twitter followers. It was liked 374,555 times. Jenner, regarded by her fans as an arbiter of what’s not and what’s not, heard. Snapchat stock dropped 6% or $1.3 billion, also in part over its decision to redesign its interface. Jenner later tweeted, “still love you tho snap ... my first love.”\n\nIn fairness to American workers, it’s a double-edged sword: They’re often times encouraged to tweet and maintain an active social media presence. And employees, particularly those who are in the public eye, are often judged by how many followers they have on Twitter when they apply for jobs.\n\nThe role social media plays in workers’ lives is “not always clear-cut,” the Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C., found. Companies, in the meantime, must remind employees to state that their opinions do not reflect those of their company. But when it comes to crossing a line — whether it’s racism, homophobia or sexism — such caveats may not enough.\n\n“This is not censorship,” Sinnreich says. “It’s about affiliation and the media’s role as amplifiers for political ideology. This story will be over in another 24 hours, but these stories will keep happening.”']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK067_rosean_ZG_20180530104554.jpg

The company said consumers would be able to buy its products and services — and potentially partners’ products as well — using either Monster tokens or fiat currencies.\n\n“We intend to utilize the blockchain technology to our marketing, accounting and audit, internal control and shipping management functions,” the company said in the filing. “We believe the blockchain innovation will bring disruptive advancement to our e-commerce and business operation systems.”\n\nAlso see: Here’s the blueprint for how ICOs are getting off the ground without SEC vetting\n\nIf it manages to raise the full $300 million, it would be the largest ICO on record, according to Coinist. Currently, the largest ICO was FileCoin’s $257 million offering in 2017.\n\nRead: Nearly half of all 2017 ICOs have failed\n\nMonster said it hopes to use its “influence, scale and global connections” to lure other e-commerce platforms onto its network, once it is established, and eventually compete with Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.75% , eBay Inc. EBAY, +0.85% and Alibaba Group Holdings Inc. BABA, -0.01% .\n\nThe shift to blockchain-based e-commerce could be seen as a Hail Mary effort by the company, which is facing mounting losses.\n\nMonster — formerly known as Monster Cable — lost a significant chunk of its revenue base when its partnership with headphones-maker Beats Electronics came to an acrimonious end in 2012. Two years later, Beats was bought by Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.21% for $3 billion. Since their divorce, Monster and Beats have been entangled in a messy legal dispute over contractual obligations, with Monster arguing that Beats owes it about $100 million, while Beats says it is owed $95 million from Monster.\n\nIn the SEC filing, Monster said it continues to incur operating losses, with a net loss of $26.7 million in 2017, and a $19.6 million loss in the first quarter of 2018. “The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain,” the company said.']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK100_monste_ZG_20180530201956.jpg

MarketWatch First Take: Box shares sink as forecast indicates slower revenue growth,http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BFC65BC82-6460-11E8-BD17-498018EA4E9F%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1,MarketWatch_Top_Stories,MarketWatch,['Therese Poletti'],,"['Box Inc. saw its shares tumble Wednesday as investors got more nervous about its slowing revenue growth.\n\nEarlier, Box reported fiscal first-quarter results, with revenue and a net loss that were within Wall Street’s expectations, but its outlook indicated continued slower revenue growth for the rest of the year. Box’s full-year outlook called for revenue in the range of $603 million to $608 million, or growth of 20% at the high end of that range, up from fiscal 2018 revenue of $506 million.\n\nWhile 20% growth is nothing to sneeze at for most companies, last year the cloud-storage company had revenue growth of 27%. Shares of Box BOX, +1.94% , which have had a big run-up in recent weeks, fell 4.6% in after-hours trading, while the S&P 500 SPX, +1.27% closed up 1.27% on Wednesday.\n\nIn a brief interview, Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie said the company has moved to a multi-product model and is adding more capabilities, including governance features, more security and artificial intelligence to its offerings. “It will show up in much more into the next fiscal year,” he said.\n\nRead more: Box CEO on Dropbox IPO: We’re like Salesforce, they’re like Netflix\n\nSome questions on the company’s call with analysts were about the pace of getting new customers and whether its new products would contribute much to revenue going forward.\n\n“By now there’s a good five, six, seven [new products], not any of them are broadly adopted or priced in a way that can drive massive revenue growth, correct me if I’m wrong,” one analyst said. Box executives cited new deals that had added “many new logos,” including adding the Defense Department’s DARPA as a new customer.\n\nLevie urged patience, telling analysts that, as the company had discussed in its fiscal fourth-quarter call, over time a greater percentage of overall sales will be coming from those newer products.\n\nBut whether or not Box can get back to its higher growth rates is a big question that investors will keep asking, until they see evidence otherwise.']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FN544_Box053_ZG_20170531175622.jpg

Charcoal versus gas grill: Which one is better?,http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2018/05/31/charcoal-versus-gas-grill-which-one-is-better.html,Fox_Latest_Headlines,Fox,[],2018-05-31 00:00:00,"['Everyone has their own opinion when it comes to charcoal and gas grilling. But is there a correct choice?\n\nRather than guessing which to use at your next cookout, we’ve rounded up the pros and cons of charcoal and gas grills so you can make a well-informed decision for what will be the tastiest choice of the summer.\n\nRegardless of the fuel, learn how to grill steaks like a pro by following these 5 easy steps.\n\nCharcoal Grills\n\nAccording to some die-hard barbecue fans, the only way to grill is with charcoal. Charcoal provides that rich, smoky flavor that even with an attached smoke box just can’t meet. Learn more about operating a charcoal grill here.\n\nPros\n\nTypically, charcoal grills reach a higher temperature than gas grills. A grill has to reach a temperature of at least 600 degrees Fahrenheit to achieve a nice sear on your meat. This is no problem for a kettle grill filled with red-hot charcoals as it can reach 700 degrees Fahrenheit. While there are gas grills that can reach higher temperatures, they’re usually on the higher end.\n\nYou get that scrumptious, smoky flavor. Ever wonder how charcoal grills give so much flavor? Turns out, that higher heat is key. When the drippings from your steak, chicken or veggies falls on the hot coals, the drippings turn into flavor-packed steam and smoke that goes right back into the meat, resulting in the amazingly unique taste of charcoal grilling.\n\nThey are easier on your wallet. A basic charcoal grill will run you about $25, while a moderately priced one can be found for around $150. Of course, higher end models go up from there, but in comparison, they are far less than the gas grills that usually cost between $130-$300.\n\nCons\n\nLonger heat up time. Charcoal grills, on average, take about 15-20 minutes to reach the proper cooking temperature (not including the time it takes to light the charcoal), whereas gas grills instantly light up and take about 10 minutes to reach cooking temperature.\n\nWhile you’re waiting for the grill to heat up, toss together some of these delicious summer salads.\n\nFuel cost adds up. A 20-pound propane cylinder can provide around 25 days of cooking time, whereas a 20-pound bag of charcoal will only yield three grilling sessions.\n\nThe cleanup is a bit more cumbersome. As opposed to the gas grill that only needs a quick scrub with a brush, a charcoal grill has to be emptied of its used ashes before it can be scrubbed.\n\nGas Grills\n\nThere’s no denying how convenient gas grills are in terms of start-up and temperature control, but that ease comes with a price.\n\nPros\n\nEasy Temperature Control. Adjusting a grill’s temperature is as easy as turning a dial. This means you can go from the low heat needed for bone-in chicken to searing hot for kebobs or steak without having to worry about moving around hot coals.\n\nQuick Start-Up. With a simple press of the ignition button and a turn of the dial, your gas grill will spark to life. After a quick preheat, you’ll be ready to grill, rather than having to wait for coals to heat up.\n\nVersatility. With a gas grill, you can easily cook delicate foods such as fish, fruit and vegetables without the worry of overpowering the food with the smoke flavor that comes along with charcoal grilling. If the smoke flavor is desired, you can easily add a smoke box that is available with some gas grills. If your grill doesn’t come with one, check out this smoke box that will deliver some serious flavor.\n\nCons\n\nAssembly time. As opposed to the charcoal grill that can be set up in a jiffy, a mid-range gas model is a bit more complicated to assemble and hook up to a propane tank.\n\nSafety. While there are safety precautions to follow with any form of cooking, you have to be extra-careful when cooking with a gas grill. Always make sure that your propane tank is properly attached without leaks, your grill is at least 10 feet from your home and deck and that the grill is free from grease. Not sure how to best clean your grill? Follow this simple check-list that’ll leave your grill looking brand-new!\n\nPortability. Though travel-sized gas grills are available, it would be much too difficult, and dangerous, to tow a full-sized gas grill around to the park or the beach.\n\nThe End Result\n\nThe charcoal and the gas grill have their pro and cons, but only you can decide which would be best for your family and lifestyle. With so many delicious grilling recipes to cook up this summer, you can’t go wrong either way.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Taste of Home.']",http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/food-drink/2018/05/31/charcoal-versus-gas-grill-which-one-is-better/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1527714571826.jpg?ve=1
How could an American high school let misunderstanding and fear triumph over love and freedom at graduation?,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/05/31/how-could-american-high-school-let-misunderstanding-and-fear-triumph-over-love-and-freedom-at-graduation.html,Fox_Latest_Headlines,Fox,['Jeremy Dys'],2018-05-31 00:00:00,"[""Mere minutes before Sam Blackledge should have given his valedictory address in front of his loved ones and classmates May 19, the principal of West Prairie High School in Sciota, Illinois took him aside.\n\nBlackledge, 18, was presented with a terrible choice: censor his speech, removing any religious references, or don't speak at his own graduation. Blackledge earned the right to speak to his classmates as valedictorian. He believes this achievement – his 4.0 GPA – would not have been possible without his faith.\n\nThe student told Fox News that he was specifically barred from mentioning Jesus Christ in his speech because “the principal told me it wasn’t appropriate for the setting.”\n\n“The most important thing in my life is Christ,” Blackledge told Fox News. “Christ is the only reason I was a valedictorian. He’s the reason I got that 4.0. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be up there. I was giving him the credit for that.”\n\nWhat is so dangerous about a young man having the humility to acknowledge that his success would not have been possible without his faith that he must be kept from the podium?\n\nThe young man should have been congratulated for his academic achievements and his speech, with themes of the triumph of justice, love, and forgiveness over evil. Instead, on what was supposed to be a joyous day for Blackledge and his family, misunderstanding and fear triumphed over love and freedom.\n\nThat school officials would censor Blackledge’s speech and deny him the freedom to share this essential part of his identity with his loved ones and classmates is inexcusable.\n\nHow many more high school graduations must be ruined by school officials who, by misunderstanding or intentional act, deny their pupils their constitutional rights to freedom of expression from the schoolhouse gates all the way through the graduation ceremony?\n\nWhat is so dangerous about a young man having the humility to acknowledge that his success would not have been possible without his faith that he must be kept from the podium?\n\nWhy is this reference to his religious identity treated any differently than another student crediting a family member for his achievements?\n\nSchool officials have us believe that humility is apparently offensive on the one hand and on the other it is virtuous.\n\nNo one thinks that a school owns the content of private speech by a valedictorian just because it occurs on school property. But even if someone thought such a misunderstanding could occur, school officials could have clarified the matter, as the U.S. Department of Education suggests, by making “appropriate, neutral disclaimers to clarify that such speech (whether religious or nonreligious) is the speaker’s and not the school’s.”\n\nJudge Frank Easterbrook writing for the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the 1993 decision of Hedges v. Wauconda Community Unit School District, explained that, rather than censor religious speech, it is far better for schools “to educate the audience rather than squelch the speaker.”\n\nThe judge explained in the decision that if a school district cannot teach the difference between providing a forum for private speech and school-sponsored speech, it is doubtful that the school is capable of teaching anything at all.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that Blackledge’s school did not heed Judge Easterbrook’s important instruction: “Schools may not prohibit their pupils from expressing ideas. And no arm of government may discriminate against religious speech when speech on other subjects is permitted in the same place at the same time.”\n\nFirst Liberty Institute, which represents Sam Blackledge, is working to ensure future valedictorians aren’t denied their freedom. We’ve asked the school to apologize to him for ruining his only high school graduation. In addition, we’ve offered to meet with school officials to help them craft policies that will ensure what happened to Blackledge doesn’t happen to anyone else.\n\nWhen all religious speech is censored then the purpose of education – and the First Amendment – is frustrated. Not only is the speaker deprived of his or her right to free expression enshrined in our Constitution by the founders as the very first liberty protected, but others are robbed of the benefit of hearing a meaningful message.\n\nThe founders enshrined religious freedom and free speech in the First Amendment because they believed that we grow from hearing perspectives we may not share and sharing our beliefs with others.\n\nOurs is a nation founded by a people persecuted for their humility in acknowledging that their success would not have been possible without something greater than themselves.\n\nWe can hardly expect our high school graduates to fight for our country, to defend our values abroad, or to choose the next leaders of our nation when we censor viewpoints that school officials might not agree with up to, and including, the day they graduate.\n\nIt’s too late for Sam Blackledge, but there will be more valedictorians in the future. Perhaps Blackledge’s lasting legacy will be that his is the last speech to be unconstitutionally censored by school officials who wrongly believe, as Judge Easterbrook put it, “that the best defense against misunderstanding is censorship.”\n\nNeal Mehrotra is a student at The George Washington University Law School and legal intern at First Liberty.""]",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/26/0/0/694940094001_5789978143001_5789978060001-vs.jpg?ve=1

"Ex-USC med school dean linked to drugs, prostitutes shouldn't lose license, attorney argues",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/05/31/ex-usc-med-school-dean-linked-to-drugs-prostitutes-shouldnt-lose-license-attorney-argues.html,Fox_Latest_Headlines,Fox,['Benjamin Brown'],2018-05-31 00:00:00,"[""The attorney for a former medical school dean at the University of Southern California argued Wednesday that his client should be allowed to continue practicing medicine, despite acknowledging that he used hard drugs during his tenure at USC.\n\nAttorney Peter Osinoff made the case on behalf of Dr. Carmen A. Puliafito during a state medical board hearing that followed Puliafito's March 2016 resignation from the university -- one of several high-profile departures from the school in recent years.\n\nOsinoff argued that while 67-year-old Puliafito has a brilliant mind, he also suffers from mental illness, which induced an “ugly side” that led to his relationship with a prostitute, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nHe noted that Puliafito was more addicted to his involvement with the young woman, identified in a previous report by the Times as Sarah Warren, than the narcotics – and asserted that Warren was the one who introduced the physician to “street drugs.”\n\nOsinoff argued his client has been recovering for several months and has since gotten a grasp on his bipolar disorder, according to the paper.\n\nPuliafito resigned as the dean of USC’s Keck School of Medicine in three weeks after Warren, 21, overdosed in a Pasadena hotel in his company, according to a detailed investigation by the Times.\n\nThe physician continued to represent the school and see patients at the university until the paper published its investigation last year that revealed Puliafito lived a secret life of drinking, drug use and partying with addicts and prostitutes.\n\nThe report, which prompted the medical board to suspend Puliafito's license, turned out to be just the beginning of a series of scandals to rock the university.\n\nPuliafito’s successor, Dr. Rohit Varma, was ousted less than a year after being appointed following revelations of a sexual harassment settlement from 15 years earlier, in which a woman accused him of unwanted sexual advances in 2002.\n\nMost recently, USC gynecologist Dr. George Tyndall, 71, was accused of sexual abuse by more than 50 women over the course of more than two decades following a bombshell report by the Los Angeles Times earlier this month that the women had complained about the physician’s behavior for years -- with the school taking no action until 2016.\n\nThe Tyndall scandal led USC President C.L. Max Nikias, 65, to announce his resignation Friday.\n\nTyndall has denied any wrongdoing in interviews with the Times.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s hearing, the state medical board alleged that Puliafito would “see patients within hours of using methamphetamine,” in addition to providing drugs and paraphernalia to Warren, and her brother Charles Warren, who was 17 at the time, the paper reported, citing a filing.\n\nOsinoff denied those claims, arguing his client never treated patients while under the influence of drugs, nor did he ever illegally supply drugs, adding that Puliafito hasn’t used methamphetamine since last July, according to the paper.\n\nThe attorney argued Warren drugged Puliafito “without his consent,” while he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on clothes, housing and rehab among other things for her.\n\nOsinoff also claimed Warren’s parents tried to extort money from Puliafito, but Sarah and Charles Warren denied the allegations, the Times reported.\n\nPuliafito attended the hearing, which will determine whether the physician can continue practicing.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.""]",http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2018/05/31/ex-usc-med-school-dean-linked-to-drugs-prostitutes-shouldnt-lose-license-attorney-argues/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1527745407951.jpg?ve=1
Day of US-NKorea meetings to salvage summit on tap in NYC,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/05/31/day-us-nkorea-meetings-to-salvage-summit-on-tap-in-nyc.html,Fox_Latest_Headlines,Fox,[],2018-05-31 00:00:00,"['A senior North Korean official and the top U.S. diplomat had dinner in New York as President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un try to salvage prospects for a high-stakes nuclear summit. It\'s the highest-level official North Korean visit to the United States in 18 years.\n\nKim Yong Chol, the former military intelligence chief and one of the North Korean leader\'s closest aides, landed midafternoon Wednesday on an Air China flight from Beijing. Associated Press journalists saw the plane taxi down the tarmac before the North\'s delegation disembarked at JFK International Airport.\n\nDuring his unusual visit, Kim Yong Chol had dinner for about an hour-and-a-half with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who traveled from Washington to see him. The two planned a ""day full of meetings"" Thursday, the White House said. Their talks will be aimed at determining whether a meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un, originally scheduled for June 12 but later canceled by Trump, can be restored, U.S. officials have said.\n\nThe talks come as preparations for the highly anticipated summit in Singapore were barreling forward on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, despite lingering uncertainty about whether it will really occur, and when. As Kim and Pompeo were meeting in New York, other U.S. teams were meeting with North Korean officials in Singapore and in the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone.\n\n""If it happens, we\'ll certainly be ready,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of the Singapore summit. Regarding the date for the meeting, she added, ""We\'re going to continue to shoot for June 12th.""\n\nNorth Korea\'s flurry of diplomatic activity following a torrid run in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests that Kim Jong Un is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and the international legitimacy the summit with Trump would provide. But there are lingering doubts on whether Kim will ever fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.\n\nTrump announced that Kim Yong Chol was coming to New York for talks with Pompeo in a tweet on Tuesday in which he said he had a ""great team"" working on the summit. That was a shift from last week, when Trump announced in an open letter to Kim Jong Un that he had decided to ""terminate"" the summit following a provocative statement from the North.\n\nPompeo, Trump\'s former CIA chief, has traveled to Pyongyang twice in recent weeks for meetings with Kim Jong Un, and has said there is a ""shared understanding"" between the two sides about what they hope to achieve in talks. South Korean media speculated that Pompeo could make a third trip to Pyongyang and that Kim Yong Chol was carrying a personal letter from Kim Jong Un and might push to travel to Washington to meet with Trump.\n\nNorth Korea\'s mission to the United Nations in New York is its sole diplomatic presence in the United States. That suggests Kim might have chosen to first go to New York because it would make it easier for him to communicate with officials in Pyongyang, North Korea\'s capital. North Korea and the United States are still technically at war and have no diplomatic ties because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.\n\nTrump views a summit as a legacy-defining opportunity to make the nuclear deal that has evaded others, but he pledged to walk away from the meeting if he believed the North wasn\'t serious about discussing dismantling its nuclear program.\n\nAfter the North\'s combative statements, there was debate inside the Trump administration about whether it marked a real turn to belligerence or a feint to see how far Kim Jong Un could push the U.S. in the lead-up to the talks. Trump had mused that Kim\'s ""attitude"" had changed after the North Korean leader\'s surprise visit to China two weeks ago, suggesting China was pushing Kim away from the table. Trump\'s letter, the aides said, was designed to pressure the North on the international stage for appearing to have cold feet.\n\nWhite House officials maintain that Trump was hopeful the North was merely negotiating but that he was prepared for the letter to mark the end of the two-month flirtation. Instead, the officials said, it brought both sides to the table with increasing seriousness, as they work through myriad logistical and policy decisions to keep June 12 a viable option for the summit.\n\nKim Yong Chol is a vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party\'s central committee. The last official of his stature to visit the United States was Jo Myong Rok, the late first vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, who visited Washington in 2000, South Korea\'s Unification Ministry said.\n\nThe White House emphasized that it has remained in close contact with South Korean and Japanese officials as preparations for the talks continue. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump will host Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan on June 7 to coordinate their thinking ahead of the summit. Trump hosted South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week.\n\nMoon, who has lobbied hard for nuclear negotiations between Trump and Kim Jong Un, held a surprise meeting with the North Korean leader on Saturday in an effort to keep the summit alive.\n\n___\n\nLederman reported from Washington and Bodeen from Beijing.

Rudy Giuliani says he's counseled Trump against firing Sessions,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/7eHDXitbk7c/rudy-giuliani-says-hes-counseled-trump-against-firing-sessions.html,Fox_Politics,Fox,[],,"['President Donald Trump’s lawyer has repeatedly counseled him not to fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions despite the president’s ongoing anger at the attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from the Russia probe.\n\nRudy Giuliani told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Trump has asked him multiple times, before and after the former New York City mayor joined the president’s legal team last month, about whether Sessions should have been fired.\n\n“I don’t think the president should do it and I’ve told him so,” said Giuliani.\n\nGiuliani said Trump consulted him last summer during the height of his rage about Sessions’ recusal. More recently, he said, Trump has not actively considered firing Sessions, but has wondered if he made the right decision in not doing so previously.\n\n“And when he asks ‘Should I have done that?’ I say ‘No, the way it is now has worked out’,” Giuliani said.\n\nThe former mayor added that he did not believe Trump would fire Sessions. The president’s anger at Sessions, who was the first senator to endorse his fledgling presidential campaign and has remained a loyal supporter, comes from the attorney general’s move last year to recuse himself from the probe, a move Sessions said was in line with Department of Justice guidelines but Trump believes birthed the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller that is imperiling his presidency.\n\nTrump’s anger remains unabated and he suggested on Twitter again Wednesday that he wishes he had never offered the job to Sessions. Giuliani stressed that Trump had every right — whether in person or on social media — to “express how he feels” about Sessions, but suggested it was a distraction to his legal team’s efforts to fight back against the ongoing investigation.\n\n“Instead of talking about Sessions, we want to be talking about Comey and Mueller,” said Giuliani, invoking the former FBI director and the special counsel. “Public opinion is turning our way; we’ve had a great turnaround on this. We should be focused on that.”\n\nSome in Trump’s inner circle have advised him against firing the attorney general because it could further ratchet up the pressure in the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election, as well as alienate a portion of the president’s conservative base who have cheered Sessions’ moves at the Justice Department. Moreover, a number of Sessions’ former Republican colleagues in the Senate have indicated they would not hold confirmation hearings for a replacement attorney general.\n\nThis could change after the midterm elections in November. Republicans on Capitol Hill want to avoid unnecessary drama ahead of the elections, but once Mueller completes his investigation some are now suggesting it may then be time for Trump and Sessions to part ways.\n\nThe mood is a shift from just weeks ago when Republican senators in particular seemed prepared to go to the mat for Sessions as part of their broader efforts to stop Trump from firing Mueller.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who golfed over the holiday weekend with the president, says he has reinforced to Trump that “the best thing for the Republican Party right now is to keep focused on good governance in the midterms.”\n\nGraham says while he shares some of Trump’s frustrations with the situation — particularly the Justice Department’s resistance to appointing a second special counsel to investigate the handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe — he doesn’t expect Sessions will depart “any time soon.”\n\nBut Graham added, these are “not lifetime appointments.” At some point, he said, Sessions will “have to make a decision” that if “you don’t have the confidence” of the president, “that will affect your ability to be effective.”']",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/31/0/0/694940094001_5791606769001_5791604008001-vs.jpg?ve=1
Top GOP senator challenges Fusion GPS founder over 'extremely misleading' testimony on Trump dossier,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/3bCPPq4mpac/top-gop-senator-challenges-fusion-gps-founder-over-extremely-misleading-testimony-on-trump-dossier.html,Fox_Politics,Fox,['Catherine Herridge'],,"['A top Republican senator is accusing the founder of opposition research firm Fusion GPS of providing testimony that was “extremely misleading, if not an outright lie,” regarding the anti-Trump dossier.\n\nFusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson was asked about his firm’s work on the dossier during closed-door testimony in August 2017. When asked specifically whether that work continued after the 2016 election, Simpson responded: “I had no client after the election.”\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, however, challenged that answer in a new letter to committee colleague Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del. “As we now know, that was extremely misleading, if not an outright lie,” he wrote.\n\nHe said that, “Contrary to Mr. Simpson’s denial in the staff interview, according to the FBI and others, Fusion actually did continue Trump dossier work for a new client after the election.”\n\nThe letter cites the House Intelligence Committee’s Republican-authored Russia report, which included a footnote detailing a March 2017 interview between the FBI and Daniel J. Jones, a former staffer for Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein. According to the footnote, Jones told agents he was leading a research organization called the Penn Quarter Group, which had “secured the services” of dossier author and former British spy Christopher Steele; an associate; and Fusion GPS “to continue exposing Russian interference” after the election.\n\nThe committee report said that the Penn Quarter Group “was being funded by 7 to 10 wealthy donors located primarily in New York and California, who provided approximately $50 million.” Grassley noted that Jones said his group planned to “push the information he obtained from Fusion and Steele to policymakers on Capitol Hill, the press, and the FBI.”\n\nJones, according to his LinkedIn profile, worked four years for the FBI doing “international analysis” and as a staffer for Feinstein. Feinstein, who is the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary committee, unilaterally released a transcript of Simpson’s testimony in January.\n\nGrassley said Simpson and Jones’ statements are subject to the federal statute 18 USC 1001, which bars lying to federal investigators. “So, despite the fact Mr. Simpson said he had no client after the election, he in fact did, and that client revealed himself to the FBI,” he wrote.\n\nGrassley, working with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., back in January sent a criminal referral on Steele to the Justice Department – claiming the ex-spy lied about his contact with the media regarding allegations against members of the Trump campaign. “As with the circumstances surrounding the Steele referral, we once again have two seemingly contradictory statements in contexts where material lies are criminal. I would welcome your views on what actions you are willing to take with regard to Mr. Simpson’s testimony,” Grassley wrote.\n\nGrassley wrote the letter in response to Coons’ concerns about potential inconsistencies in Donald Trump Jr.’s committee interview. Grassley countered with his own concerns.\n\nSeparately, as reported by Fox News, after much legal wrangling on both sides of the Atlantic, Steele is expected to sit down for a videotaped deposition on June 18 in London for civil litigation filed against Buzzfeed, which published the unverified Steele memos in January 2017. The Steele-written memos were funded by the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton through Washington, D.C.-based law firm Perkins Coie, which hired Fusion GPS for $1.8 million. The unverified information was also used by the FBI and pushed to various journalists during the 2016 campaign.\n\nEvan Fray-Witzer, the Boston-based lawyer for Russian technology executive Aleksej Gubarev, who is suing Buzzfeed for defamation of his companies, said in a statement: “We look forward to asking both Mr. Steele and Mr. Simpson about the work they performed after the election, which is when the memo concerning our clients was written. Obviously, if the work was performed for the Penn Quarter Group, it’s just more evidence that this was paid-for, private opposition research and not – as Buzzfeed tries to portray it – some sort of ‘government investigation.’”\n\nThere was no immediate response from Simpson’s attorney or Daniel Jones.\n\nMaking materially false or fraudulent statements to Congress can be pushishable by fines and imprisonment of up to eight years in prison.']",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/30/0/0/694940094001_5791567686001_5791565179001-vs.jpg?ve=1

Congress mulls lowering age requirement for truck drivers to prevent national shortage,http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/politics/~3/cw7xjwLbJfM/congress-mulls-lowering-age-requirement-for-truck-drivers-to-prevent-national-shortage.html,Fox_Politics,Fox,['Terace Garnier'],,"['When Juwan Mack turned 21, one of the first things he did was carry out his dream. The South Carolina resident applied for, and received, his trucking license.\n\n“I remember as a kid always being at my grandma’s house. Her house was right next to a main highway,” Mack said. “So, I remember being on the side of the road and a truck would come by and I would pull my hand down for them to beep the horn…childhood dreams.”\n\nBut Mack, now a truck driver for CCC Transportation, had to wait years for that dream to become a reality, thanks to a law that requires drivers of commercial vehicles to be over 21 to cross state lines.\n\nNow, Congress is considering a new piece of legislation proposed by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., called the Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy Act, also known as the DRIVE-Safe Act. It aims to allow 18 year olds with their commercial driver’s licenses, or CDLs, the ability to drive commercial vehicles across state lines in an attempt to help prevent a nationwide driver shortage.\n\nMost states allow truck drivers under 21 to crisscross a state, but those 18 to 20 are not allowed to cross state lines.\n\nMany truckers are reaching retirement age in the next decade and leaving the workforce, and companies say they are having a tough time hiring new drivers. In South Carolina alone, more than 8,200 locally owned trucking companies said they were suffering from a driver shortage.\n\nThe American Trucking Association published a report in October of 2017 showing that last year’s national shortage of 50,000 drivers may increase to 174,000 drivers by 2026.\n\n“The truckers would need to hire close to one million truckers over the next 10 years. You have a lot of people retiring,” Hunter said.\n\nSupporters say lowering the age limit would expand the labor pool. While the pay is decent – the average trucker’s salary is about $60,000 a year – it’s a tough job that requires drivers to be on the road for months at a time.\n\n“It’s such a crisis with the shortage of truck drivers – you can ask any business person, any fleet operator, any private business that has their own fleet one of their biggest problems is workforce, in particularly truck drivers,” said Rick Todd, president of the South Carolina Trucking Association.\n\nThe apprenticeship program would require the drivers under 21 years old to complete, at minimum, 400 hours of on-duty time, including at least 240 hours of driving time chaperoned by an experienced driver and equip all training trucks with cameras and a set a speed cap of 65 mph.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation set the rule decades ago because of concerns that drivers under 21 had a higher risk for accidents.\n\nNow, the proposal has come under criticism by some who agree with the DOT, arguing that allowing younger drivers behind the wheel of a truck is a recipe for disaster.\n\n“Young drivers both lack overall experience and are less safe behind the wheel than their older counterpart,” Todd Spencer, president of the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, wrote in a letter to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which is exploring the issue. “In fact, commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers who are 19 to 20 years of age are six times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes.”\n\nThe association believes all efforts should instead focus on improving the industry instead of trying to hire more cheap labor.\n\n“This has been tried before and no one with any common sense thought it was a good idea,” Spencer wrote in the letter. “Nothing has changed since that time and no disruptions have ever taken place due to any perceived shortage of drivers. These latest efforts are just more ways to keep driver-churn going and keep wages as low as possible.”\n\nBut Hunter said the change is necessary because the trucking industry keeps America going by delivering goods, ranging from fresh vegetables to petroleum, around the country – and costs will go up on goods and the availability of those goods will go down if the issue isn’t addressed.\n\n“There is no downside to doing this because you already have people on the road that are in the ages of 18 to 21. They went through all of the training, all the safety stuff. So they’re already doing it, they just simply can’t drive over the state line,” Hunter said. “So, I think this fixes a dumb issue that Congress needs to fix.”\n\nMack feels the legislation is important and will help the industry bring in younger drivers.\n\n“I feel like a lot of kids that are underage will jump into it because there is no longer a wait,” Mack said, “you know, no limitation on where you can go or how far you can drive.”']",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/30/0/0/694940094001_5791546303001_5791538045001-vs.jpg?ve=1

Here is obvious evidence that the Golden State is a one-party state in ways that not even Rhode Island or Alabama could muster.\n\n\n\nThese preliminary data are subject to official reversal by California secretary of state, but the larger message is irrefutable: The value of partisan affiliation is dropping like a rock in America’s most populous state.\n\n\n\nThat should come as no surprise since there has been a push for more than a decade to get away from the partisanship that many in California and across the country say is to blame for poor government and an inability to address pressing issues.\n\n\n\nThe most aggressive step taken by California was to end partisan primaries. Since 2012 voters of all registrations participate in the state’s June primary elections with the top two finishers, regardless of affiliation, meeting up for a runoff in November.\n\n\n\nThis was the brain child of moderates, both Republican and Democrat, who observed that the primary system as constituted in most of the country provides too great an incentive for extremism. By essentially eliminating primaries, California reformers reasoned, they would eliminate the extremism that primaries produce.\n\n\n\nThis would be something like saying that you only find out about having cavities when you go to the dentist so you stop going to the dentist all together. Problem solved.\n\n\n\nPartisan affiliation for most of American history was a function of class, ethnicity and geography. You were a Democrat or Republican because everyone you knew was one, just like your father and grandfather and great grandfather… There were liberal rock-ribbed Republicans in the Northeast and conservative yellow dog Democrats in the Deep South.\n\n\n\nBut the rise of a truly national media in the form of talk radio, cable news and, most of all, the internet, has facilitated what political scientist Mo Fiorina says is a better “sorted” electorate. The conservative Republican base has driven out liberals while the liberal Democratic base has driven out conservatives, and those who harbor dissenting views but still remain have strong incentives to remain quiet.\n\nSo many voters feel alienated these days not because the parties have become more polarized but because the parties have become so homogenous. People have tangled oftentimes seemingly contradictory views and seldom fit into narrow ideological silos. And as the parties have become more ideological it has deepened the sense of alienation for many.\n\n\n\nParties were less ideological 50 years ago and tended to reflect coalitions of regional factions that could cobble together politically competitive efforts. Now parties are more ideological since the old cultural bonds that kept people in their political lanes have substantially broken down. If anybody tell you that “all politics is local,” tell them to look at the ads politicians are running in 2018 midterms.\n\n\n\nIn this well-sorted space, there is greater incentive for ideological extremism. Incumbent members of Congress who would have once run for re-election on their own records and value to the district now race to the right or left to accommodate the demands of activist voters keyed up on immigration or impeachment or whatever is causing the deepest electric thrum to vibrate through the electorate.\n\n\n\nPartisan primaries may reveal those trends, but they are hardly the cause of them, as Californians are beginning to find out.\n\n\n\nIt is not hard to imagine that within the next decade the number of unaffiliated voters will also grow beyond the number of Democrats. Without the incentive of primary participation who wants to join a political party? Neither brand is particularly popular – for good reason – and partisanship in general has a bad reputation.\n\n\n\nSo what does that future look like? Probably more chaotic but even more factious. When these red and blue dinosaurs die off, they will not be replaced by new megafauna but rather a profusion of small scavengers.\n\n\n\nOver here are the Democratic socialists. Over there are the white nationalists. Up yonder is La Raza. Down there are the Libertarians.\n\n\n\nMany Americans have long yearned for a “third party.” They came awfully close in 1992 with Ross Perot’s aggressive pragmatism and flipcharts, and the desire for something that seems like a compromise between conservatives and liberals hasn’t abated. But the problem is you don’t get one more party. You get 10 more or 20 more.\n\n\n\nOnce we decide that we want “something else” than the two mainstream offerings it throws wide the doors to the kind of narrow-interest politics that bedevil many other nations.\n\nImagine the California primary of 2028 in which the top two finishers in a crowded field each claim less than a fifth of the vote and in November voters are left to choose between two candidates who got there by being ablest to energize the loudest, crankiest subset of supporters. Folks would be begging for authoritarian oligarchs after a few cycles of that.\n\n\n\nThere are lots of things that could be done to make America’s two-party system better.\n\nThe combination of misguided but well-intentioned campaign finance reforms that weakened national parties and a Supreme Court decision that empowered unaccountable outside groups has been particularly damaging. There may be some solutions there. And certainly the improved ability of partisans through voter data to draw ever more tortured congressional districts needs some consideration, too.\n\nBut whatever the solution for ways in which weak parties are unequal to our moment of strong partisanship it seems unlikely to us that the best remedy is to weaken them even further.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: THE FRESHMAKER\n\n“…there will be no less reason to fear that the pestilential breath of faction may poison the fountains of justice [if the Supreme Court had been made subordinate to the legislative branch].” – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 81\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: OLD HICKORY DIDN’T MISS\n\nTennessee State Museum: “In the spring of 1806, Andrew Jackson and Charles Dickinson had a series of disagreements. … One argument concerned a horse race scheduled between Jackson’s horse Truxton and a horse owned by [Dickinson’s father in law]. …Dickinson publicly said insulting things about Jackson’s wife Rachel. … Finally Dickinson wrote a statement that was published in a Nashville newspaper calling Jackson a coward… Jackson wrote a letter challenging Dickinson to a duel. … [On this date 212 years ago] the two men and their seconds met in Kentucky for the duel (Dueling was outlawed in Tennessee). … Dickinson shot first, hitting Jackson in the chest. However, Jackson wore a coat that was too big for him. This may have upset Dickinson’s aim and the bullet missed Jackson’s heart. Then, though in great pain, Jackson carefully aimed and fired at Dickinson. The bullet hit Dickinson in the abdomen, and he eventually died from blood loss. … Jackson was highly criticized for dueling and for killing Dickinson. However he never apologized for the act.”\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at\n\nHALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 40.8 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 54.2 percent\n\nNet Score: -13.4 points\n\nChange from one week ago: down 0.6 points\n\n[Average includes: Gallup: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CBS News: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; CNN: 44% approve - 51% disapprove; IBD: 38% approve - 56% disapprove; Pew Research Center: 42% approve - 54% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nControl of House\n\nRepublican average: 41.8 percent\n\nDemocratic average: 48.4 percent\n\nAdvantage: Democrats plus 6.6 points\n\nChange from one week ago: no change\n\n[Average includes: CNN: 47% Dems - 44% GOP; CBS News: 50% Dems - 41% GOP; Pew Research Center: 48% Dems - 43% GOP; Monmouth University: 49% Dems - 41% GOP; Quinnipiac University: 48% Dems - 40% GOP.]\n\n\n\nI’LL TELL YOU WHAT: NEVER TWEET\n\nThis week, Dana Perino and Chris Stirewalt discuss what it takes to go from having a successful television show on a Monday to being unemployed on a Tuesday.

Beto O'Rourke, his Democratic challenger, 50 - 39 percent in the Texas Senate race, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released today. This compares to the results of an April 18 survey by the independent Quinnipiac University, showing the race too close to call with Sen. Cruz at 47 percent and O'Rourke at 44 percent. Today, Cruz leads 57 - 35 percent among men, up from 51 - 40 percent April 18. Women go 44 percent for Cruz and 42 percent for O'Rourke, compared to last month when women went 47 percent for O'Rourke and 43 percent for Cruz. … Independent voters are divided with 43 percent for O'Rourke and 41 percent for Cruz. Texas voters approve 52 - 39 percent of the job Cruz is doing and give him a 49 - 38 percent favorability rating. O'Rourke gets a 30 - 19 percent favorability rating, while 50 percent of voters don't know enough about him to form an opinion of him.”\n\n\n\nGOP bears down on immigration ads while Dems prefer health care - USA Today: “House Republican candidates are blanketing the airwaves with TV ads embracing a hard line on immigration — a dramatic shift from the midterm elections in 2014, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from Kantar Media. Republicans have aired more than 14,000 campaign ads touting a tough Trump-style immigration platform this year. The barrage underscores why House GOP leaders worry that passing a legislative fix for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, referred to as DREAMers, would put GOP candidates at risk heading into the fall election. … Democrats bombard voters with ads that promise to protect Obamacare, shore up Social Security and expand Medicare, according to the data from Kantar’s Campaign Media Analysis Group (CMAG).”\n\n\n\nTrump focuses outreach on big donors - Politico: “President Donald Trump is plunging into the big-donor game, planning an appearance at a six-figure-a-head fundraiser benefiting his allied super PAC. Trump is expected to address America First Action’s leadership summit, according to the super PAC’s president, Brian Walsh. The president is slated to speak on the second night of the two-day conference, to be held June 18-19 at Trump International Hotel in Washington. Getting in won’t come cheap. Donors will need to pony up at least $100,000 to attend; VIP status will be at least $250,000. While the president has lent his support to the group and appeared at benefit dinners for America First Action’s backers, he has yet to appear at a fundraiser for it. Under federal law, Trump can only ask for donations of up to $5,000 for any super PAC, though he can appear at the event. The super PAC will begin sending out invitations to major GOP donors on Wednesday.”\n\n\n\nPhoenix mayor resigns to run for Congress - Fox News: “Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, an anti-Trump Democrat who has held the post in Arizona's capital city for more than six years, stepped down Tuesday to focus on a run for Congress. Stanton first announced in October that he intended to run for the U.S. House seat currently occupied by departing Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who is seeking the U.S. Senate seat of retiring Republican Jeff Flake. Under Arizona's ‘resign to run’ law, Stanton had to resign from the mayorship by the end of May in order to maintain his federal candidacy. Wednesday is the filing deadline for the race in Arizona's 9th Congressional District, which is centered in Tempe and includes parts of nearby communities, including Phoenix. The primaries are scheduled for Aug. 28, and the general election will be Nov. 6. Stanton is expected to face at least two other Democrats, while as many as five Republicans are expected to run. Independent candidates and those representing smaller parties also will run.”\n\n\n\nTRUMP KEEPS UP SPY CLAIMS DESPITE GOWDY ASSURANCES\n\nThe Hill: “President Trump’s mind hasn’t been changed by a top Republican’s assessment the FBI acted appropriately in using a confidential source in the Russia probe, the White House said Wednesday. ‘Clearly, there’s still cause for concern that still needs to be looked at,’ White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters. Sanders was responding to Rep. Trey Gowdy’s (R-S.C.) comments that ‘the FBI did exactly what my fellow citizens would want them to do’ by having a confidential source speak with Trump campaign associates who were suspected of having contacts with Russians during the 2016 election. His statements rebutted the president’s unsubstantiated claim that the Obama administration embedded a spy in the Trump campaign in order to boost Democrats.”\n\n\n\nTrump pushed Sessions to reverse recusal - NYT: “[President Trump’s] grievance was with Mr. Sessions: The president objected to his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. Mr. Trump, who had told aides that he needed a loyalist overseeing the inquiry, berated Mr. Sessions and told him he should reverse his decision, an unusual and potentially inappropriate request. Mr. Sessions refused. The confrontation, which has not been previously reported, is being investigated by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as are the president’s public and private attacks on Mr. Sessions and efforts to get him to resign. Mr. Trump dwelled on the recusal for months, according to confidants and current and former administration officials who described his behavior toward the attorney general. The special counsel’s interest demonstrates Mr. Sessions’s overlooked role as a key witness in the investigation into whether Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the inquiry itself.

BASEBALL\n\n“You woulda been thrown out at first if I was playing, buddy.” – A friendly taunt from Rep. Steve Scalise to Rep. Trent Kelly as Scalise attended his first practice with the GOP’s congressional baseball team since the one where he was nearly killed by a gunman last year. It’s part of an engrossing profile on Scalise and the race for House speaker.\n\n\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n“I've done stand-up comedy myself. I once made a joke about my mother that she found so offensive she didn't speak to me for a week. If anyone knows about crossing lines in the pursuit of a joke, it would be me. But there's a HUGE difference between the lazy, all-encompassing bin of ‘political correctness’ and lines which should not be crossed. Making a joke about a long-maligned ethnic group at a time of increasing racial polarization would seem to be one of those common-sense times, and having a bipolar mental illness is not a sufficient excuse. ABC is in the business of risk. They cut her loose because her show was too risky based on their business model. I liked her reboot, and I missed the Connors. But if you think they caved merely due to ‘political correctness,’ then you have truly jumped the shark. That's too bad.” – Patrick S. Duffy, Los Angeles\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Oh dear, Mr. Duffy! I’m afraid I didn’t make myself clear enough here. The “new political correctness” we were talking about on Tuesday wasn’t the decision to scrap Roseanne Barr’s television show. The new political correctness we were discussing was the one in which people would defend a bigot or even change their taste in art for the sake of political tribalism. Conservatives complained for decades about P.C. and the enforcement of speech codes, etc. They had a point since we ought not be policing the free exchange of ideas or banning speech just to protect people’s feelings. But there is an increasingly strong impulse on the populist right these days to submit to the blunt judgement of the tribe when it comes to these matters. I hope most Americans will decline to engage passionately on the subject of what one television network did with one show, but many will simply on the grounds of tribal grievance. I have already seen plenty of “I’m not defending her, but….” Egads. How much proof does Barr have to provide that she’s far beyond the bounds of decency before people shun her? The new political correctness is different in many ways, but like the old, demands that you substitute the judgement of others for your own.]\n\n\n\n“Chris: Your Monday assessment of the ‘new political correctness’ in the light of Roseanne's latest outrageousness is razor sharp and diamond clear. I was cheering to myself at several points in the analysis. ‘If you are fool enough to allow strangers to dictate your likes or dislikes in music, movies, books and television there’s not much we can tell you...’ Amen.” – Jack Lavelle, Phoenix\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: We quote George Orwell here quite often and I think the occasion demands it again: “To see what is in front of one’s nose needs a constant struggle.” Thinking for oneself is HARD. Surrendering your will to the demands of the mob is easy. And now that mobs are easy to form and work in the close quarters of social media it’s getting harder to retain your own judgement, ethics and worldview. But it is certainly worth the fight!]\n\n\n\n“Stick shifts, be they three on a tree or four on the floor should stay, at least until ‘they’ can figure out how to automate a gas fill. Every day, millions fill their tanks the same way their grands and greats did over a century ago! Now that is something to complain about. It’s fun to drive with a clutch (look it up). Puttin’ on gas? Not so much.” – Bob Wood, Bismarck, N.D.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: You should know, Mr. Wood, that Brianna intervened on your behalf to include this reaction to Tuesday’s Time Out about the enduring popularity of manual transmission.

In addition to the metal tariffs, President Trump has threatened to impose levies on imported automobiles, the bulk of which comes from allies like Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Japan and the European Union.\n\nThe White House has tried to leverage the tariffs to get Canada and Mexico to agree to its demands on a rewrite of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and it has pressured Europe to make trade concessions on other fronts, including cutting the amount of metals the bloc exports to the United States.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration’s aggressive approach appears to have only hardened the resolve among the United States’ closest allies to fight back against Mr. Trump’s demands.']",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/business/31dc-tariffs-print/01dc-tariffs-1-facebookJumbo.jpg

After their meeting, Mr. Rosenstein gave Mr. McCabe a copy of a draft firing letter that Mr. Trump had written, according to two people familiar with the conversation.

To keep her incarcerated a day longer is morally and economically indefensible.”\n\nIn the Mic interview, Ms. Kardashian West said she had been in contact with the White House on behalf of Ms. Johnson to bring “her case to the president’s desk” and to lobby the White House to release her. A White House official confirmed Wednesday that Ms. Kardashian West had reached out to Mr. Kushner, who has been working on prisons and the sentencing issue, through his wife, Ivanka Trump, the president’s eldest daughter.\n\nMs. Kardashian West’s visit might also end up inadvertently highlighting the conflicts and uphill battles ahead for the administration’s plan for a criminal justice system overhaul. Mr. Kushner has taken the reins on the project and is pushing legislation that could help decrease recidivism by offering incentives for prisoners, including job training programs, halfway houses and early release.\n\nBut Mr. Kushner has encountered opposition from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a hard-liner who last year began reversing the Obama administration’s efforts to ease penalties, like mandatory minimum sentences, for some nonviolent drug violations. A difference in views has led to a turf-war that recently resulted in the resignation of the director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nThe degree to which Ms. Kardashian West’s interest in the overhaul of the criminal justice system expands beyond Ms. Johnson’s case is unclear. Ms. Kardashian West was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday, but after advertising her new line of nude lip liners and sharing thoughts from her sister on motherhood, she spoke directly about Ms. Johnson to her 60 million Twitter followers: “Happy Birthday Alice Marie Johnson. Today is for you.”\n\nAfter the meeting, Mrs. Kardashian West said in a statement relayed through her publicist that she was hopeful Mr. Trump would eventually grant Ms. Johnson clemency.\n\n“We are optimistic about Ms. Johnson’s future and hopeful that she — and so many like her — will get a second chance at life,” the statement said.']",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/us/politics/31dc-KARDASHIAN/31dc-KARDASHIAN-facebookJumbo.jpg

About 11 million of them were able to enroll as a result of states’ decisions to expand the program under the Affordable Care Act. Republican attempts to repeal the health law last year would have largely undone the Medicaid expansion and caused most of the new recipients to lose their coverage.\n\nVirginia’s House of Delegates voted to approve Medicaid expansion during the regular 60-day legislative session that ended in March. But the Senate, whose members were not up for re-election last fall, remained opposed. Lawmakers failed to pass a state budget then because of the issue.\n\n“That is debt, and I have four kids who are going to be having to pay for that for the rest of their lives,” Senator Amanda Chase, a Republican from Chesterfield, said of the federal funds spent on Medicaid expansion, explaining her vote against it on Wednesday. “It’s not just a fiscal burden, but it’s not the best solution for people who want real, quality health care.”\n\nThe turning point came in April when State Senator Frank Wagner, a Republican from Virginia Beach, said he had changed his position and would support Medicaid expansion, joining one other Republican, Senator Emmett W. Hanger Jr. of Augusta, and all 19 Senate Democrats. Mr. Wagner changed his mind after a work requirement was added to the plan.\n\nTwo other Republican state senators, Ben Chafin and Jill Holtzman Vogel, also voted for Medicaid expansion on Wednesday.\n\n“I came to the conclusion, for me and my district, that no just wasn’t the answer any longer,” Mr. Chafin. who represents an economically struggling district in southwestern Virginia, said on the Senate floor. “Doing nothing about the medical conditions, the state of health care in my district, just wasn’t the answer any longer.”\n\nThe approval did not come without last-minute drama: Thomas Norment, the Senate majority leader and steadfast opponent of Medicaid expansion, tried unsuccessfully to block it in the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, and again on the Senate floor on Wednesday, when he pushed to pass a version of the budget that did not include it. Instead, a substitute budget including amendments that allowed for Medicaid expansion, offered by Senator Hanger, was approved.']",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/science/31MEDICAID2/31MEDICAID2-facebookJumbo.jpg

"A journalist reappears, and Russia cries foul",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/a5VLhwYylew/index.html,CNN_World_News,CNN,"['Analysis Nathan Hodge', 'Cnn Moscow Bureau Chief']",,"['To recap: Russia-watchers received a fresh shock on Tuesday night, when they saw reports that Russian journalist and Kremlin critic Arkady Babchenko had been gunned down in an apparent contract killing.\n\nUkrainian police reported that an unidentified gunman shot and killed him in the entryway to his apartment in Kiev, an apparent murder that bore the hallmarks of a contract hit, and appeared to be part of a wave of targeted killings in Ukraine directed at opponents of Moscow.\n\n""I would like to apologize for what you all had to go through ... because I\'ve buried friends and colleagues many times, and I know it\'s a sickening-vomiting feeling when you have to bury your colleagues. You\'re sorry that they forced you to experience all this,"" he said. ""But in another way, it was impossible.""\n\nIn Babchenko\'s telling, Ukrainian security services had saved his life. They informed him that a hit was ordered on him from Russia, and the money had already been transferred: $40,000 (something Babchenko ironically described as a respectable price on his head).\n\nUkrainian officials said they had foiled a deadly plot, and that the person suspected of carrying out an attempted assassination attempt on Babchenko was in custody. But despite the surprise ending, the Ukrainians handed a public-relations gift to the Russian government.\n\n""That Babchenko is alive is the best news,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Facebook. ""Wish it was always like that. It\'s too bad that in other cases, the masquerade didn\'t quite come off.""\n\nZakharova said the Ukrainian story had been concocted for ""propagandistic effect."" Senior Russian lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev compared the Babchenko case to the Salisbury poisonings , something used ""by hook or by crook to defame Russia.""\n\nAnd that\'s likely a point that Russian officials will further amplify. Russia has vehemently denied any responsibility for the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury, much as it has denied backing separatists in Ukraine\'s Donbas region and meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Earlier Wednesday, before Babchenko\'s surprise reappearance, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the West was using the case ""to promote Russophobic views and to create an uncomfortable situation for our country in every possible way,"" state news agency TASS reported.\n\nThat response -- accusing the West of stirring a campaign of Russophobia -- has been the default Russian response to everything from the Skripal case to the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in eastern Ukraine in 2014. In each case, the Russian government issued furious denials and charged the West with creating ""fake news"" to blacken Russia\'s name.\n\nIn the case of Babchenko, they can now claim that fake news is real. And others are questioning why the Ukrainians staged Babchenko\'s death.\n\n""We are relieved that Arkady Babchenko is alive,"" said Nina Ognianova, the Europe and Central Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. ""Ukrainian authorities must now disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the Russian journalist\'s murder. CPJ is investigating this unprecedented situation and will have no further comment until we have more details.""\n\nBabchenko is no stranger to controversy. Last year, he fled Russia, saying he was subject to a campaign of harassment ""so personal, so scary,"" that he was forced to flee his native country.\n\nThe main trigger for this wave of harassment? A Facebook post. In December 2016, a Russian plane carrying the Alexandrov Ensemble, a much-loved military choir, crashed into the Black Sea on the way to a performance for Russian troops at a base in Syria. Babchenko said he used the post -- in which he refused to express sympathy for the crash victims -- to remind readers that Russia was also backing the Syrian government in a brutal offensive against the city of Aleppo.\n\nRussians reacted angrily. Prominent lawmakers and state media vilified him, and Babchenko said he no longer felt safe in Russia\n\n""My home address has also been published on the Internet, together with an invitation \'to visit,\'"" Babchenko wrote. ""I have received threats to me and my family by the thousand -- in my email inbox, on Facebook and by phone.""\n\nBabchenko in many respects has had an extraordinary career. Before working as a journalist, he served as a conscript soldier in Russia\'s 1994-96 war against Chechen separatists. He then returned to military service as a contract soldier during a second war in Chechnya that began in 1999. That second conflict helped propel Russian President Vladimir Putin to the presidency. That conflict also propelled Babchenko\'s writing career: He published a memoir about his life as a young soldier, One Soldier\'s War\n\nBut this case has raised serious questions for some about the impact of this hoax on the practice of journalism.\n\n""Babchenko is a journalist, not a policeman ... and part of our job is trust, whatever Trump and Putin say about fake news,"" said Andrei Soldatov, a Russian journalist and expert on intelligence services, on Twitter. ""I\'m glad he is alive, but he undermined even further the credibility of journalists and the media.""']",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180530155206-02-babchenko-presser-grab-super-tease.jpg
Why journalist's death was faked -- and why he couldn't tell his wife,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/U7c-NHtgLvo/index.html,CNN_World_News,CNN,"['Angela Dewan', 'Lindsay Isaac', 'Judith Vonberg']",,"['(CNN) A Russian journalist and critic of the Kremlin, reported to have been shot dead in Ukraine , showed up alive at a news conference on Wednesday to declare that his murder was faked by Ukrainian security services in an effort to foil an assassination plot against him.\n\nIn a stunning development, Arkady Babchenko, 41, walked into a room of journalists in Kiev who had been expecting to get an update on his slaying.\n\nHe apologized to his wife, Olechka -- who on Tuesday was reported to have found him bleeding to death at his apartment -- for the ""hell"" she had gone through. Ukrainian officials offered a jaw-dropping explanation for his so-called death: to expose a Russian plot against him.\n\nTwo people, suspected of being the person who ordered the hit and the potential assassin, are in the custody of the security services, spokeswoman for the Ukraine Prosecutor General, Larisa Sargan, said later Wednesday.\n\nThe elaborate ruse raised many questions. Chief among them, why was it necessary to go to such extraordinary lengths to expose the plot, who was in on it, and what did Olechka Babchenko really see when she found the bleeding body of her husband?\n\nAt the news conference on Wednesday, none of these was addressed. Instead, flanked by Ukranian security officials, wearing a hoodie and occasionally flashing a sheepish smile, Babchenko launched into an explanation of the ploy.\n\nBabchenko (center) appears at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.\n\nHe said Ukranian officials first told him about the threat against him, and their elaborate plan to thwart it, a month ago.\n\nBabchenko said he became convinced that Russian government agencies were involved in the alleged plot when he was shown his passport photo and personal documents, which he said could have been accessed by Russian special services.\n\n""An offer was made to take part in this special operation,"" Babchenko said. ""I had no choice but to cooperate.""\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, later revealed more details about the alleged plot. According to a statement released by the SBU, Russian special services recruited a Ukrainian citizen -- identified only as ""G"" -- who was tasked with finding, for a payment, perpetrators for a number of high-impact terrorist acts, including the assassination of Babchenko.\n\n""He proposed to his friend, a former member of the ATO in the east of Ukraine, to execute, for $30,000, the contract kill on a Russian journalist, Arkady Babchenko. He has already transferred a deposit of $15,000,"" said Vasyl Hrytsak.\n\nAccording to the SBU, ""G"" also received a dossier on Babchenko with detailed information about his journalistic work and private life, including data on the target himself, his wife, children and parents. Information included phone numbers, bank account details and passport data, the SBU said.\n\n""G"" faces a number of accusations, including aiding in the commitment of a terrorist act and endangering the life or health of a person to violate public safety. A pretrial investigation is underway.\n\nAt times during the news conference, Babchenko seemed emotional.\n\n\'Anti-Russian provocation\'\n\nOnly a day earlier, Ukranian authorities claimed they had launched an investigation into Babchenko\'s death and even released a sketch of the suspected killer.\n\nPolice claimed he was shot in the back and died in an ambulance, citing his friend and supervisor, Ayder Muzhdabaev, deputy general manager of Ukrainian TV channel ATR. Ukraine blamed Russia for his ""death.""\n\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko congratulated security services on a ""brilliant operation"" in ""saving the life"" of Babchenko. On his official Twitter account, Poroshenko said Ukrainian law enforcement agencies are becoming ""stronger in counteraction to Russian aggression."" He later met Babchenko, embracing the journalist, and posted footage of the encounter on Twitter.\n\nThe affair seemed unlikely to improve the frosty relations between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nIn a statement , the Russian Foreign Ministry described the operation as ""obviously calculated propaganda"" and ""anti-Russian provocation.""\n\n""We state that the questions of life and death in Ukraine, as well as the international community\'s confidence in Ukraine\'s policy, are nothing more than bargaining chips for the anti-Russian hysteria of the Kiev regime,"" the statement said.\n\nVladimir Dzhabarov, Deputy Chairman of the International Affairs Committee of Russian Federation Council, told state media outlet RIA Novosti that Kiev is now ""disgraced in the eyes of the whole world.""\n\nArkady Babchenko covering unrest in Kiev in 2014.\n\n\'I apologize for what you had to go through\'\n\nDuring the news conference Wednesday, Babchenko thanked the Ukrainian security services for saving his life. He also apologized to his wife and all those who believed he had been killed -- but said the secrecy had been unavoidable.\n\n""I would like to apologize for what you all had to go through ... because I\'ve buried friends and colleagues many times, and I know it\'s a sickening-vomiting feeling when you have to bury your colleagues,"" he said. ""Also I would like to apologize to my wife for the hell she went through in those two days. Olechka, I\'m sorry, but there were no options here, either.""\n\nHe described how he first claimed to have broken his leg and then was requested to ""disappear somewhere"" in the weeks leading up to the staged murder, in a bid to thwart the assassins.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, a journalist and colleague of Babchenko, Simon Ostrovsky, described Wednesday\'s revelation as ""totally shocking and unprecedented.""\n\n""For those of us who know Arkady personally, this is something that we\'re going to have to process for a little while longer,"" he said.\n\nKateryna Lisunova, an acquaintance of Babchenko who works in New York as a special correspondent for Ukrainian television station Pryamiy, was in the ATR newsroom in Kiev to watch the news conference and posted a video on Facebook of people clapping, cheering and jumping as Babchenko appeared.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists, which had earlier decried Babchenko\'s ""murder,"" expressed relief that he was alive but demanded answers from the Ukranian authorities. ""We are relieved that Arkady Babchenko is alive,"" said Nina Ognianova, CPJ\'s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator. ""Ukrainian authorities must now disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the Russian journalist\'s murder.""\n\nFlowers lie under a picture of Babchenko placed on the memorial wall of Moscow\'s journalists house before he was revealed to be alive.\n\nBabchenko \'no longer felt safe\' in Russia\n\nNews of the apparent murder had stunned Kiev on Tuesday. Shortly after Babchenko\'s death was announced, Moscow and Kiev began blaming each other for the killing of the journalist, who is a vocal critic of the Kremlin and left Russia in 2017, saying he no longer felt safe.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman implied Russia had orchestrated the ""killing"" of Babchenko, while Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed that idea and slammed Ukraine as an unsafe place for journalists to work.\n\nOn Wednesday Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the affair was a propaganda exercise by Ukraine, but that she was happy Babchenko was alive.\n\nBabchenko left Russia after he criticized the Kremlin in a Facebook post in 2017.\n\nHe faced backlash after commenting on the crash of a Russian plane transporting the world-famous military choir Alexandrov Ensemble en route to Syria. They were traveling to perform for pilots involved in Russia\'s air campaign on Aleppo.\n\nBabchenko called Russia an aggressor, and accused the country of killing children in its air support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\'s regime.']",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180530153822-01-babchenko-presser-grab-super-tease.jpg

Opinion: Staged murder of Russian journalist comes at a heavy price,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_world/~3/nVFjvFpYgnw/index.html,CNN_World_News,CNN,['Michael Bociurkiw'],,"['Michael Bociurkiw is a writer and development professional who has worked on emergencies on several continents, most recently as a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(CNN) Without firing a shot or sacrificing a life, the Ukrainian security services have scored a direct propaganda hit against the Kremlin in its staging of the ""murder"" of Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko. But at what cost?\n\nThe unfolding story over the past 24 hours is as shocking as it is bizarre.The journalism community and friends of Babchenko mourned as news of his alleged murder -- by an assailant painted as cowardly for shooting him in the back three times -- was reported Tuesday.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, the 41-year-old Babchenko was paraded at a press conference organized by Ukraine security services. The journalist, who was a prime target for his scathing criticism of the Kremlin, said the Ukrainian authorities approached him a month ago with evidence that his murder was planned for $30,000. ""I understood it had to be an operation of Russian special services. I had no choice but to participate in the sting,"" he told a packed Kiev news conference today.\n\nTwo suspects are in custody and Ukrainian authorities say they\'ve established a link to Russian special forces. To some, the operation was reminiscent of Egypt\'s attempt in 1984 to fake the murder of a leading opponent of Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nIn a statement, the Russian foreign ministry said it was glad Babchenko is alive, but called the incident ""another anti-Russian provocation"" and said it was ""obviously designed for a certain propaganda effect.""\n\nThat Babchenko would allow himself to take part in a sting operation, even dupe his close friends and colleagues, to catch his alleged assailant compromises journalists at a time when they are under attack in Ukraine and in many other places around the world.\n\nDo we need another excuse for the media to be branded as fake or manipulative? Kiev authorities said they were made aware of the plot four months ago and staged the elaborate ploy in order to capture suspects. Ukrainian television channel 112 is reporting that a suspect also planned to set up a ""weapons base"" in the Ukrainian capital in order to launch more terrorist attacks.\n\nWrote my friend, journalist Anna Nemtsova: ""No fake news ever shocked reporters working in Russia and Ukraine more than this story.""\n\nWhile expressing relief that Babchenko is alive, many journalists and media watchdogs have come out slamming the operation.\n\nThe global media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders, said , ""it is always dangerous for States to play with the facts, and also on the back of journalists."" And the Committee to Protect Journalists says that it is investigating what it calls ""an unprecedented situation"" -- adding that the Ukrainian authorities need to disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the murder.\n\nOne journalist described the sting as ""a mindless and tragic mistreatment of public empathy that discredits so many things at once -- Ukraine, Russian liberals, journalists. Only the Kremlin wins.""\n\nWhatever the explanation, the operation could have been done in such a way as to not compromise the journalist -- or the news media as a whole.\n\nUkrainian law enforcement has a well-deserved reputation for incompetence, cover-ups and colluding with corrupt oligarchs. Several murder cases -- including that of Pavel Sheremet, a journalist who was killed in broad daylight in Kiev in 2016 -- remain unsolved and not one wanted major figure from the previous administration of Viktor Yanukovych has been placed behind bars. And so the temptation to show a major win in its hybrid war against Russia must have been irresistible. But this sting operation resembled something more like an amateur public relations exercise than a serious counter-intelligence operation.\n\nMoreover, parading Babchenko at a press conference in Kiev plays into the hands of those who accuse the media of being fake or untrustworthy. As we traverse the shoals of a post-truth world it can only further undermine people\'s trust in journalism. Furthermore, the credibility of Ukrainian security officials will suffer in the long term. Anything the Ukrainian Government says henceforth will now have to be double and triple checked.\n\nUkraine\'s beleaguered president, Petro Poroshenko, also needs to answer for what could very well end up being a major strategic communications disaster for his country. With elections next year and his approval ratings in the single digits, he has back-pedaled on internationally-backed reforms designed to break up the state security service, the SBU, into a a leaner organization that is more professional and efficient -- and less prone to corruption.\n\nAt a time when Ukraine is positioning itself as a responsible member of the European community and is begging international donors for assistance in countering ""fake news,"" why would it contribute to its spread?\n\nAs for Babchenko? It could be that the price for his head has significantly increased, and he will likely require round-the-clock protection for the rest of his life. Then again, it is not often that one gets to read what has been written about you after your death.']",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180530190322-01-babchenko-presser-super-tease.jpg

"In South Sudan, a Never-Ending Hunger Season Puts Millions in Danger",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/world/africa/south-sudan-hunger-season.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,NewYorkTimes_World_News,NewYorkTimes,"['Megan Specia', 'Kassie Bracken']",2018-05-30 00:00:00,"[""Even during harvest time in January, when food was most abundant, more than five million people — almost half the population — did not have enough to eat. Now, as food runs out over the next few months, international officials expect that number to grow considerably, with millions potentially facing acute malnutrition.\n\nPhoto\n\nThis year’s harvest was the smallest on record since South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011, with the country producing only a fraction of its needs, according to the World Food Program.\n\nOn top of that, peace talks have stalled and cease-fires have largely been ignored, which means the fighting has cut off some areas from emergency help. Aid workers have been targeted by government and rebel fighters alike, making food distribution increasingly difficult.\n\nEven here in the capital, which had been largely immune to the food crisis, many families are finding it impossible to pay the steep prices demanded in the city’s markets, their options vanishing as the currency crashes.\n\nFamilies from across the country pile into a clinic for malnourished children, setting aside the political and ethnic divides that have torn this new nation to shreds. Some mothers come from areas backing the government. Others have husbands, brothers and sons who fight for the rebels.\n\nDozens of the women lie outside on the floor, their children wrapped in blankets. The signs of malnutrition are clear: Swollen bellies and emaciated limbs. Skin hanging in folds from tiny bones. Bodies covered in open sores, the painful result of edema breaking the skin.\n\nPhoto\n\nCecilia Kideen struggled to feed her 9-month-old daughter, Sarah. Her breast milk is not enough, as she barely eats one meal a day.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n“The mothers,” she said, “are really suffering.”\n\nSouth Sudan, the world’s newest nation, was born from an enormous international push to end decades of conflict between the north and south of what was then Sudan.\n\nBut just two years later, the new country was at war.\n\nIn December 2013, a feud between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar quickly descended into a conflict that has fractured the country, killed tens of thousands of people and decimated what was already one of the world’s least developed nations.\n\n“There are very few populations that are escaping the impacts of hunger,” said Elizabeth White, Oxfam’s South Sudan policy adviser. “But all roads lead back to conflict and insecurity.”\n\nTalks between the government and opposition leaders have been postponed. But even if peace can be reached, the hunger crisis still looms.\n\nFarming on the Front Lines\n\nThe civil war in South Sudan has set off the largest refugee crisis in Africa since the Rwandan genocide, the United Nations says. More than two million people have fled the country, crippling food production. Nearly two million others have abandoned their homes and remain scattered around the country, leaving behind ghost towns and untended fields.\n\nAt the nation’s southern border, dozens of refugees cross a narrow bridge into Uganda each day, bringing stories of hunger with them.\n\nMary Yar, 20, arrived with her 1-year-old son at a small reception center on the Ugandan side. At the site, the first assessment that refugees go through is a malnutrition screening\n\n“There is no food there,” Mrs. Yar said of her home village, pointing back toward the bridge to South Sudan.\n\nPhoto\n\nDuring the height of the hunger season last year, South Sudanese arrived by the thousands, said Geoffrey Chandiga, a child assessment officer.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe keeps a tally of new arrivals on a whiteboard, noting that officials are bracing for an uptick in the months ahead.\n\nTwo years ago, South Sudan’s war expanded into southern parts of the country that had long been seen as the country’s breadbasket. People flooded across the Ugandan border. Most have yet to return.\n\nWhen United Nations peacekeepers visited the areas in early 2017, they saw entire villages burned to the ground.\n\n$321.70 for a Plate of Beans\n\nUnder a sharp midmorning sun in the capital, Elizabeth Kenyi and her husband, Johnson Ali, plucked vegetables from their garden along the White Nile, a tributary of the Nile.\n\nFor two decades, they have sold their okra, peppers and tomatoes in a nearby market. But even with a plentiful harvest this year, they are finding it harder than ever to feed their family of seven.\n\n“The money that I got from the garden is useless,” Mr. Ali said.\n\nPhoto\n\nWhile their produce commands a higher price than it did last year, prices for the staple grains they buy, like maize and sorghum, are climbing fast.\n\nSouth Sudan's currency is in freefall and hyperinflation has squeezed virtually everyone. Before the war, one American dollar was worth about five South Sudanese pounds. By March, a dollar was worth about 220 pounds.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe impact has been devastating. A 2017 World Food Program report determined that the relative price of a meal in South Sudan was among the highest in the world.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

To put it another way, a meal that would cost a New Yorker just $1.20 would cost someone in Juba the equivalent of $321.70.\n\nAwaiting Aid That Can’t Be Delivered\n\nWith agriculture in tatters, emergency aid is keeping a growing share of the country alive.\n\nBy early 2018, half of South Sudan’s population relied on food aid, according to the United Nations, and the percentage will grow as the hunger season reaches its peak in the coming weeks.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut delivering that aid is another matter entirely. The rainy season hits during these lean months, too, turning many roads into rivers of impassable mud.\n\nBeyond that, at least 100 humanitarian workers have been killed here since the start of the conflict, 30 in the last year alone, targeted by warring parties that think the efforts are helping their enemies.\n\nEven within the protected camps set up around the country by the United Nations, there is not enough food to go around.\n\nMrs. Chok, the woman who boiled leaves for her children, had been at a protected area in Juba for a month. The camps sprang up in 2013 as ethnic minorities who feared violence from government forces and their supporters fled to the base of the United Nations peacekeeping mission. Many stayed, and the camps have sprawled into makeshift cities ringed by barbed-wire fences.\n\nThe United Nations provides food to registered camp residents, but thousands inside have no official status, so they rely on their neighbors for food. The rations are simply not enough.\n\nAid workers say that so much of the country is on the move — with vast numbers of people fleeing places where violence erupts — that most new arrivals to Mrs. Chok’s camp have not been registered in more than a year. That means she and countless others receive nothing.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nStaying in the camps is dangerous enough. Attacks and sexual abuse by camp officers have been widely reported. Other accounts have emerged of women trading sex for food. But leaving the camp brings an entirely new set of risks.\n\nPhoto\n\nTafisa Nyattie, 30, who has lived in a camp here since 2013, has six children. Her food rations regularly run out, so she leaves the camp daily to gather firewood, hoping to earn enough money for milk and soap to wash her children’s clothes.\n\nShe walks up to three hours in each direction, braving threats from government forces before returning with a large bundle of wood on her head.\n\n“They will rape you or beat you, and sometimes they kill you,” Mrs. Nyattie said, recounting the well-documented dangers women have faced in the conflict. “Some government soldiers tried to rape me.”\n\nOn another day, she said, she was beaten and her leg was badly injured. But when she saw how hungry her children were, she decided she had no choice but to head back out again.\n\n“You just go, and you don’t know if you will come back to your children,” Mrs. Nyattie said.\n\nHunger’s Youngest Victims\n\nThe malnutrition clinic offers a chilling glimpse of what this hunger season may hold.\n\nThe hospital ward, frequently dark because of intermittent electricity, is treating nearly a dozen more children each day than it did this time last year. They come from around the country to be weighed, measured and given antibiotics and a milk formula before moving on to Plumpy’Nut, a peanut-based nutritional paste — if their bodies can handle it.\n\nPhoto\n\nMany of the families here are not even victims of the horrors that have chased millions from their homes. Some have jobs, career plans and families to lean on — yet their children are still going hungry.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSelwa Anania, a restaurant worker from Juba, brought her 2-year-old son, Taban Zacharia, to the clinic. Her small salary does not go far in the market. Most days, it is only enough for a single meal of porridge.\n\nSylvia George, 27, fanned her son, Mandela Bisa, 2, who lay half-conscious on a bed, hooked up to an intravenous drip. The child’s father is a student at Juba University, and the three live with Ms. George’s mother, whom they rely on for food. There is never enough.\n\nFor now, with the peak of the hunger season still weeks away, the clinic manages the steady flow of patients, said Josephin Ruben, the head nutritionist.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut, she noted anxiously, there “will not be enough when we get to June and July.”""]",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/07/world/xxsouthsudan-hunger-09/xxsouthsudan-hunger-09-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg

It was a time when unwanted pregnancy carried so much social stigma that many young women and their parents went to great lengths to conceal it.\n\nMany smaller institutions were also involved in arranging adoptions, with little or no supervision. As they closed, their files were handed over to the government’s child protection agency, Tusla.\n\nTusla took over the St Patrick’s Guild files in 2016 and discovered, while attempting to help adopted children trace their birth parents, that some of the births had been fraudulently registered. In a statement, it said it had referred the fraudulent registrations to the police. But few if any of the people responsible are likely to be still alive.\n\nOfficials at the child protection agency said their main priority now was to identify and locate all the people whose birth certificates were falsified.\n\n“We are very aware that this will be a shock for people affected and may cause upset and anxiety,” the agency said in its statement. “We will work closely with people throughout and offer support, including counseling, while allowing them their autonomy to decide what steps they want to take.”\n\nWednesday was not the first time Irish officials felt obliged to apologize for the treatment of unwed mothers.

The two sides met on Sunday in Panmunjom, a “truce village” in the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two Koreas.\n\nThe diplomats and technical experts are probably working out an agenda for the meeting, and the American side is looking to secure detailed commitments from Kim Jong-un that his regime is willing to abandon its nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnalysts said that Ms. Choe and Mr. Kim were likely to work on drafts of a potential declaration that could be issued at the summit meeting, with wording from North Korea about getting rid of its nuclear weapons and a guarantee from the United States that it would not interfere with the North’s regime or demand redress for human rights abuses.\n\n“Ms. Choe is probably asking for nonaggression and even the stopping of joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea because the North feels threatened by it,” said Chon Hyun-joon, a visiting professor at Woosuk University in Jeongju City. “The North Koreans are very good at getting what they want at the last minute, while it seems Trump is a little more impatient.”\n\nMs. Choe was an interpreter for the North Koreans during previous nuclear negotiations known as the six-party talks, which started in 2003 and eventually broke down in 2009.

Human rights groups say the lack of accountability is particularly jarring, arguing that the attacks on the Rohingya involve exactly the kind of mass atrocities this court was created for. Its mandate is to judge crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide.\n\nAn obvious obstacle is that Myanmar, where the violence was meted out, is not a signatory to the court. That means the court cannot address crimes committed in Myanmar, by Myanmar citizens, unless the United Nations Security Council authorizes it, which most observers say is unlikely.\n\nAnd Myanmar has shown little interest in punishing those responsible or pursuing the evidence, which has been documented by rights groups and journalists and corroborated by satellite imagery.\n\nSo prosecutors and human rights lawyers are trying a novel approach: They argue that since hundreds of thousands of Rohingya have been deported to Bangladesh, and since this can be construed as continuing crimes against humanity taking place in Bangladesh, a member of the court, the prosecutor can have jurisdiction to act. Bangladesh is not suspected of crimes, but would provide the route to jurisdiction.\n\nThe request submitted on Wednesday by the group Shanti Mohila, or Peace Women, goes further: Its lawyers say that as long as Myanmar refuses the return of the Rohingya and forces them to live in terrible conditions, its “crimes of apartheid, persecution and genocide continue” even outside its territory. If the court goes along with the request, it would mark a radical departure in international law.']",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/world/31rohingya-1/31rohingya-1-facebookJumbo.jpg

Secretary of state Mike Pompeo's in-person impressions and Trump's gut feelings could be keys in the possible nuclear summit,http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/TPgqjnSOI5M/index.html,CNN_Top_Stories,CNN,"['Zachary Cohen', 'Barbara Starr', 'Jenna Mclaughlin']",,"['Washington (CNN) While Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\'s recent meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were billed primarily as diplomatic missions, the face-to-face encounters have also served as valuable intelligence gathering opportunities that are helping shape US officials\' understanding of the reclusive dictator and guide ongoing talks between the two countries.\n\nA series of constantly updated US intelligence assessments have determined that Kim will come to the negotiating table with his own red lines revolving around a single calculation: How much, if any, of his nuclear weapons program does he give up while still assuring the survival of his regime and his singular position in power?\n\nThese intelligence assessments, largely led by the CIA\'s Korea Mission Center, are examining all issues that could impact Kim\'s thinking and approach to the negotiations, including the impact of US-backed economic development how Kim can maintain the loyalty of his top military commanders. The issue of Kim\'s concern for his safety and survival was even addressed by President Donald Trump in public comments when he guaranteed the Kim\'s safety if he agreed to denuclearize.\n\nThe US intelligence community has been working to understand what makes Kim tick since he took power in 2011 -- gathering details related to his psychological makeup, leadership style and personality in order to support the policymakers tasked with dealing with North Korea\'s nuclear weapons program.\n\nAnd that effort has only been amplified in recent weeks as US officials continue to lay the groundwork for on-again, off-again talks between Kim and Trump in Singapore on June 12.\n\nDespite Trump\'s threat last week to call off the summit , the White House has indicated that preparations are still under way.\n\nRepresentatives from Washington and Pyongyang have been dispatched in recent days to conduct various meetings, and in his most significant gesture so far, Kim has sent his former intelligence chief and close confidante Kim Yong Chol to New York to meet with Pompeo.\n\nEven after Trump made his cancellation announcement, Pompeo has continued to work on preparations for a potential summit. Defense Secretary James Mattis has also continued to publicly emphasize diplomacy led by Pompeo.\n\nThose familiar with Pompeo\'s thinking have said that his meeting with Chol will set some of the terms and agenda for a potential summit -- but most importantly Pompeo loyalists believe the meeting is a sign that he is the senior US official, short of the President, that Kim is willing to work with.\n\nIf Pompeo is included at the summit table, his role will include ensuring both Kim and Trump keep to the agenda and do not get unduly distracted by their rhetoric, one US official said.\n\n""Secretary Pompeo has spent more time with the \'living God\' than any other American ... {Kim} has been sheltered from foreign view very deliberately up until now,"" Nick Eberstadt, American Enterprise Institute scholar and adviser to National Bureau of Asian Research, told CNN.\n\nWhile sources have relayed various rumors about Kim to intelligence officials over the years, Eberstadt said the US can be most confident in assessments regarding North Korea\'s ""objectives because those haven\'t really changed between three generations of Kims.""\n\nOn the same page?\n\nWhile US intelligence officials have determined Kim is unlikely to completely surrender his nuclear program as part of a negotiation with the US, Trump has laid out a red line of his own -- saying any summit must include a guarantee that North Korea\'s weapons can no longer threaten the US or its allies.\n\nBut a series of US intelligence assessments have concluded that while Kim could give up some weapons including warheads and missiles, he may not be willing to give up his capabilities to regenerate his program.\n\nThat would include keeping scientific, engineering and technical capabilities and personnel which would be seen by Kim as his insurance policy to ensure he could stay in power, officials said.\n\n""He is not going to do anything that allows him to become vulnerable,"" one official told CNN. He also could decide to keep some hidden weapons inventories, officials acknowledged.\n\nSo far, US officials say, the Kim regime hasn\'t taken any steps on denuclearization that could not be readily reversed. They said the May 24 destruction of underground tunnels to test nuclear devices was a ""serious gesture."" But it ""doesn\'t foreclose further testing"" at other locations, one official said.\n\nUS satellite imagery recorded technical equipment and gear being removed from the site prior to the destruction of the tunnels, three US defense officials say. ""They are not going to give up anything valuable,"" one official said.\n\nIn addition the US has preliminarily identified other potential sites where the North Koreans could dig new underground tunnels for testing.\n\nKim a \'rational actor\' with his position largely set\n\nIntelligence assessments have concluded that Kim is coming to the table with his position largely set with regards to what he will give up and what he plans to retain or possibly hide away.\n\nIt\'s not clear what security guarantees the US could give Kim that would convince him to give up his entire program, including those scientific, engineering and technical capabilities including underground sites that could shield key items.\n\nThat idea is largely supported by the US intelligence community\'s assessment that Kim is a ""rational actor"" motivated by the survival of his own regime.\n\nPompeo, who took a leading role on the North Korea issue even before he was confirmed as secretary of state, has had direct contact with Kim on two occasions -- providing unique insight into the isolated leader\'s personal makeup that also supports the latest findings from the intelligence community.\n\n""My personal view is that the assessment hasn\'t changed: he\'s a rational actor who has consolidated power; he\'s in control,"" said Ambassador Joseph R. DeTrani, who previously served at the Department of State as the special envoy for Six-Party Talks with North Korea.\n\nA former intelligence official specializing in Asia who maintains contact with current officials told CNN: ""I\'m sure [CIA] would stick by the line that Kim just wants to die peacefully of old age.""\n\nThe CIA did not respond to CNN\'s request for a comment.\n\nBut Pompeo himself has said that the meeting not only supported the intelligence community\'s existing assessment, but that Kim\'s behavior indicated he was sincere about pursuing a path toward denuclearization.\n\n""I did get a sense that he was serious,"" Pompeo said.\n\n""The economic pressure that has been put in place by this global effort that President Trump has led has led him to believe that it is in his best interests to come to the table and talk about denuclearization,"" he added.\n\nCurrently the highest-ranking US administration official to meet with Kim, Pompeo\'s observations support the idea that Kim is not irrational or crazy -- an image that has been perpetuated at times by the media, some lawmakers and even President Trump himself, according to Bruce Klingner, a former deputy division chief for Korea at the CIA who\'s now a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation\n\n""He was painted as someone who the US could not count on to not start a war,"" Klingner said. ""We are seeing some of that now as people realize that Kim, contrary to perception, is not crazy or irrational.""\n\nValue of direct contact\n\nNorth Korea\'s history of isolation has traditionally forced US intelligence agencies to utilize second-hand information gathered through interviews with individuals who have had direct contact Kim during his life.\n\nAnalysts try to put together a profile of a leader based on readouts from people who have met with them and reading about them to get a sense of their psychology and how they make decisions, Klingner said.\n\nWith an isolated leader like Kim, intelligence is rarely collected directly from the source, making Pompeo\'s contact so valuable.\n\n""Having Pompeo in a room with Kim provides direct contact and offers insight into Kim\'s mannerisms, how capable he is as a leader, and how much he relies on others,"" according to Klingner.\n\n""Having direct access to someone should provide a lot better insight,"" he said.\n\nPompeo is not specifically trained to interpret body language indicators or other subtle details that may have presented themselves in these meetings, but he was accompanied by intelligence officials who were taking note of these cues, a source familiar told CNN.\n\nTwo US officials have told CNN that Kim was very straightforward, professional, calm and on top of his brief in his meeting with Pompeo, adding that he knew and could discuss the issues in detail.\n\nAnd one source briefed on the matter told CNN that it was clear to Pompeo that Kim understands how to present himself as a fairly normal politician.\n\nBut while those who meet with Kim often determine he is not necessarily insane, Klingner warned that the difference between those misconceptions and the impression Kim gives off in person can also lead to an overreaction.\n\n""When someone meets with Kim, they often come back sort of in awe -- realizing that he is not the crazy guy in the basement -- and with the conclusion that the US can deal with him,"" he said.\n\n""But due to the fact that they often go into the meeting with a misconception of Kim based on caricatures from outside intelligence community, the perceptions often shifts from one extreme to another,"" he added.\n\nPompeo, however, has expressed a sense of cautious optimism about Kim\'s intentions.\n\nEven after Trump threatened to cancel the scheduled summit last week, Pompeo said he was ""hopeful"" discussions could get back on track, adding there was ""little doubt"" in his mind that Kim understood the scope of what the US was asking for with regards to the permanent denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nHe has also cautioned that North Korea has made and broken promises in the past.\n\n""President Trump has made clear we are going to work to get a meeting set up, the two of them will meet. In the event it fails, respectfully, President Trump will walk away and the pressure will remain but in the event we reach a resolution it would be a wonderful thing for the world,"" Pompeo said last week after Trump threatened to cancel the summit.\n\nOne source with knowledge of the situation told CNN that while some progress has already been made to this point, there is still a general understanding within the administration that the North Korean regime remains unpredictable -- as it has been for decades.\n\nAnd despite Pompeo\'s assurances that he believes Kim is serious about wanting to negotiate, some within the administration remain deeply skeptical about North Korea\'s intentions -- specifically their willingness to give up their nuclear weapons, the source said.\n\nTrump the wild card\n\nIt remains unclear as to how Trump is personally preparing for the potential sitdown with Kim, but he has told advisers he\'s confident in his ability to sway the North Korean leader in person.\n\nBut the President\'s push for a face-to-face meeting with Kim is raising concerns that he may disregard the vast intelligence resources provided on Kim in favor of leaning on his own instincts.\n\nAn intelligence profile of Kim is provided for Trump in his daily briefing, according to DeTrani, but it remains unclear as to whether the President regularly reads intelligence reports provided to him.\n\n""That profile includes intelligence related to Kim\'s personality, negotiation tactics, personal history and potential weaknesses so that the President might be able to anticipate certain moves once they are in the same room,"" DeTrani said.\n\nUltimately, intelligence analysts are trying to enable policymakers to make the most informed decisions possible, but ""at the end of the day, you can lead a horse to water but you can\'t force someone to read the briefing,"" according to Klingner.\n\n""Trump has thrown out the usual diplomatic playbook and the concept of bureaucratic timelines,"" Klingner said. ""Traditionally, the US would not deploy a president to negotiate terms but to sign the agreement once the details were in place.""\n\n""Trump doing the opposite, implementing a top-down approach,"" he added. ""He\'s not going to go through tons of background materials or meetings with experts but instead, as he wrote in Art of the Deal, goes with his gut.""']",https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180509203511-01-pompeo-kim-jong-un-2nd-trip-super-tease.jpg

We are looking for something that has never been done before,"" said the official.\n\nWhat precisely that means remains unclear, but the North Korean regime has historically shown an unwillingness to relinquish its nuclear capabilities, which it views as a guarantee of survival.\n\nAccording to the official, Pompeo\'s meeting is part of a renewed effort by the US to convince North Korean officials that denuclearization will result in a ""brighter future"" for their country.\n\nPreviously, the US has floated the idea of providing the North with economic assistance and sanctions relief should it agree to a timetable for abandoning its nuclear weapons program.\n\n\'We will be ready\'\n\nPrior to Kim\'s arrival in New York, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that the Trump administration was still aiming for a June 12 summit meeting.\n\nReferring to denuclearization, Sanders said that, ""as long as that is part of the discussion, we\'re going to focus on the June 12"" date.\n\n""We are preparing and expect that to take place on June 12 and if not,"" she said, ""we\'ll be ready on July 12.""\n\nThe high-level meeting was intended to help convince the North Korean delegation that denuclearization will result in a ""brighter future.""\n\nPompeo and Kim\'s high-level meeting comes amid a flurry of diplomatic activity on both sides of the Pacific.\n\nOver the weekend, Kim Jong Un called an impromptu second meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In at the Demilitarized Zone that separates the two countries and reiterated his apparent commitment to denuclearization.\n\nThis was followed Monday by preparatory summit talks between US diplomats and North Korean officials, also at the Demilitarized Zone.\n\nThe official dinner menu featured traditional American staples such as beef and corn.\n\nOn Wednesday a source familiar with US-North Korean relations revealed that the visiting US delegation, led by Philippines Ambassador Sung Kim, had extended its stay ""for at least another day.""\n\nMeanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in Pyongyang Thursday for meetings with his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho.\n\nLavrov is the latest in a string of high-level meetings staged by North Korea following years of isolation, as it looks to build alliances and strengthen its negotiating position ahead of the possible June 12 summit.\n\nEarlier this month, Kim Jong Un traveled to the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, the second meeting between the two leaders since March.\n\nNorth Korean diplomat Kim Yong Chol shakes hands with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nAbout turn\n\nWednesday\'s meeting between Pompeo and Kim represents a remarkable turn-around given that the talks nearly fell apart last week when Trump said he was calling off the June 12 meeting in Singapore.\n\nThe White House said in a background briefing that North Korean officials hadn\'t answered their calls, frustrating their attempts to plan for the meeting.\n\nBut they also complained about a senior North Korean foreign ministry official\'s comments after he dismissed Vice President Mike Pence as a ""political dummy.""\n\nPence had drawn a comparison between the administration\'s hopes for North Korea and the ""Libya model,"" which could be a reference to starkly different things. It could be read as a way for the country to divest itself of nuclear weapons, or seen as a reference to the overthrowing and killing of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.\n\nKim Yong Chol is a powerful surrogate for Kim Jong Un. The vice chairman of North Korea\'s Party Central Committee, he is the top official in charge of relations between North and South Korea and has been present in all recent high-level meetings with South Korea.\n\nHe is also a former head of North Korea\'s Reconnaissance Bureau, an espionage and special operations organization. He is believed to have been involved in a torpedo attack that sank the South Korean warship Cheonan in 2010, killing 46 South Korean sailors.\n\nClarification: This article has been updated to clarify a US delegation is staying in South Korea for at least an extra day.

And wouldn\'t you know it, Jesus has real nice taste in planes.\n\nJesse Duplantis, leader of Jesse Duplantis Ministries and the owner of three other private jets, is asking his followers to chip in so his ministry can purchase a brand new Dassault Falcon 7X , which runs about $54 million.\n\nIn a video recently published on his website , Duplantis says the planes get him closer to the Lord -- both literally and figuratively -- and he had a divine conversation in which Jesus asked for the new aircraft by name.\n\n""It was one of the greatest statements the Lord ever told me, he said, \'Jesse do you want to come up where I\'m at?\'"" the minister says. ""\'I want you to bleed me for a Falcon 7X.\'""\n\nBy ""bleed,"" Duplantis -- er, Jesus -- apparently meant ""ask for donations.""\n\nDuplantis goes on to tell his followers that jets, especially nice ones with good fuel efficiency, allow him and his ministries to reach more people around the world. And no, it wouldn\'t technically be his, it would be the ministry\'s.\n\n""All it\'s gonna do is it\'s going to touch people, it\'s going to reach people, it\'s going to change lives one soul at a time,"" Duplantis said of the aircraft.\n\n""I really believe that if Jesus was physically on the earth today, he wouldn\'t be riding a donkey,"" he added with a chuckle.\n\nIn the video, Duplantis also shows his followers a photo of him standing beside his other three jets: a Cessna Citation 500, an IAI Westwind II, and a Dassault Falcon 50.

According to prosperity gospel preachers and believers, nice things like jets and cars and rent money are God\'s way of blessing people for a faithful life.

To them, such luxury is not at odds with Jesus\' teachings of moderation and humility.\n\nAnd Duplantis is not the only preacher claiming to be having conversations with the Almighty about mid-range business aircraft.\n\nEarlier this year, prosperity preacher Kenneth Copeland acquired a Gulfstream V jet from director Tyler Perry , paid for by donations from his followers.\n\nCopeland and Duplantis also discussed the necessity of private jets on a 2016 episode of Copeland\'s show , ""Believer\'s Voice of Victory,"" during which Copeland described commercial air travel as being ""in a long tube with a bunch of demons.""\n\n""The world is in such shape, we can\'t get [to followers] without [private jets].

It turns out, it can be bad for your physical health, too.\n\nA new study published in the Annals of Behavioral Medicine, an academic journal, suggests people who divorce have a greater likelihood of smoking and lower amounts of physical activity.\n\nResearchers at the University of Arizona studied more than 5,700 people, using the English Longitudinal Study of Aging, a long-term health study of adults over 50 in the U.K. There are seven sets of data in the study, collected every two years, beginning in 2002. Some 900 of the study participants were divorced or separated and had not remarried. The rest were married.\n\nThey reported their life satisfaction, their exercise frequency, smoking status and measurements of their lung function and levels of inflammation. Those who were divorced or separated had a 46% greater risk of dying during the study than their counterparts who were still married. (The researchers controlled for factors like gender, health, age and socioeconomic status.)\n\nWhy the deterioration in divorcees’ health? Divorced or separated participants, especially women, were less satisfied with life than their married counterparts in the study, the researchers found. That creates an unhealthy and potentially fatal spiral: Lower satisfaction with life was also linked to lower levels of physical activity and lower levels of physical activity is linked to greater risk for an early death.\n\nThat said, not all marriages are the same, and it’s important to distinguish between healthy, happy ones and toxic ones, that might be impacting one or both partners’ health negatively, said Jennifer Behnke, a licensed marriage and family therapist based in Juno Beach, Fla. “In a miserable relationship, you’re sitting on the couch, watching TV, feeling that toxicity of resentment and not getting your needs met,” she said.\n\nBut this isn’t the first study that has shown a link between divorce and a negative impact on health. A 2009 study from researchers at the University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins University found that divorced or widowed people have 20% more chronic health conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or cancer, than married people.\n\nDivorced or widowed people also have 23% more mobility limitations than married people, such as trouble climbing stairs or walking one block. People who never married have about the same number of chronic health conditions as married people. But they do report 13% more depressive symptoms and 12% more mobility limitations than people who are married.\n\nHealthier partners might actually help their spouse stay healthier, too, Bourassa said. “If you imagine a husband or wife who doesn’t smoke and their partner does, one might try to influence the other’s behavior. In many ways, when relationships end, we lose that important social control of our health behaviors.”\n\nStill, divorce doesn’t have to lead to poor health outcomes, the researchers of the latest study said. Quality of life can actually improve for people who have ended relationships that are unhealthy for them. In fact, right after a divorce, individuals will often hit the gym even more, as they re-enter the dating world, Behnke said.\n\n“It’s called a ‘revenge body’ for a reason.”\n\nBut smoking and exercise could be important factors to watch in divorcees, Bourassa said. “If we know someone who is divorced, maybe we should ask, ‘Are you smoking? Are you getting enough physical activity?’” he said.']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK089_MLDivo_ZG_20180530151115.jpg

I have excellent credit. However, his credit is terrible. We have had several discussions about paying off his debts and putting us in a better position to purchase the home.\n\nWhile going through the process of purchasing a home, I discovered that he had outstanding bills and he did not pay off his $10,000 IRS tax debt that he incurred prior to us getting married. After consulting several lenders, no one will let us purchase a home together. The only way we can purchase a home is if I do it alone.\n\nI am perfectly fine with this. The problem is that he has two children — one girl and one boy — from a previous marriage and he wants them to have a room at our house. They reside with their mother in another state and visit us for the summer and the Christmas break. We have a child together and as we are still in our 30s, we are planning to have another.\n\nAlso see: My fiancé postponed our wedding, secretly bought a house—and told me I could pay rent\n\nBecause the house is being purchased with my name and on my salary alone, I can only qualify for a smaller mortgage than we had originally anticipated. I want a nicer, newer house with three bedrooms. He wants a much older home that needs a lot of updating, but will have enough rooms to accommodate his children.\n\nWe can’t seem to agree. Since he did not take care of his part, I do not feel like I should compromise by living in an older home that I will not be happy in just so they can have their own room. In fact, I feel that the final decision is mine because I have to sign for everything.\n\nHe ignores the fact that his debt is the reason why we are in this position, and he is only concerned about making his kids feel welcome when they come to visit (they are his words). We have to two pull out beds for guests to sleep on, so it’s not like they are sleeping on the floor.\n\nHow can we resolve this issue? I don’t want to spend any extra money than I have to or put us in a financial bind, yet he refuses to compromise on anything.\n\nDeadlocked in Indiana\n\nDear Deadlocked,\n\nOften times, the clue is in the question. Or the headline. In this case, the clue is in your sobriquet. “Deadlocked” says all you need to know. You can’t go forward. At least, not to buy a house. You can’t agree on the size and type, and it’s an unequal conversation because you are putting your good credit and name on the line, not your that of your husband. So it’s easy for him to call the shots when he is taking none of the risk.\n\nThe other problem: Given that he has a list of existing bad debts, which he did not disclose to you, there is a significant trust issue here. He needs to pay off his debt to the Internal Revenue Service, and any other unpaid bills, before you buy a house as a married couple — even if your name is the only one on the mortgage and the deed. There is a breach of trust with you as well as a breach of his pledge to repay this debt with the lenders.\n\nDon’t miss: We plundered our 401(k) to invest in a friend’s business — now we fear it’s a Ponzi scheme\n\nGood credit matters. Over the lifetime of a 30-year mortgage, a buyer with a fair credit score can end up spending $21,000 more than a buyer with an excellent credit score for the typical U.S. home, according to a report released by real-estate website Zillow Z, +5.22% on Tuesday. In San Jose, which has a median home value of $1.3 million, a buyer with the lower credit score can end up paying $129,000 more than a buyer with an excellent credit score over that 30 years.\n\nThe final decision is yours. I agree 100% with that. Your money. Your credit rating. Your name on the mortgage. But that won’t make for a happy life together in this new house, or a happy marriage. It will also cause more resentment every summer and Christmas — a time of year that requires no extra family pressure — when his two children come to stay. Your romance and finances should be on solid ground before you buy, or have another child.\n\nThat means: No new house. Not this year, anyway. Credit scores factor into relationships more than you would think. Americans are still nursing their wounds from the Great Recession and want to find a partner who shares the same financial values. Some 42% of adults say knowing someone’s credit score would affect their willingness to date that person. So please don’t feel guilty about pulling out on what could be the biggest investment of your life.\n\nAlso see: My sister wrote $10,000 checks from our late mother’s bank account—what can I do?\n\nOne member of the Moneyist Facebook Group suggests this as a compromise: “I’m willing to help buy a bigger house that can accommodate your kids, but I need you to help with that. If you can pay off your IRS liens and fix your credit in the next 12 months, we’ll get the bigger house. If not, we’ll move forward on buying the smaller house, and when you have your credit fixed, we can always look at trading up. Deal?” If I were him, I’d take it.\n\nPostcript: I’m not against pullout beds, per se. Murphy beds can be both convertible and save space, and could be easy solution for turning a den into a bedroom during the holidays, especially if his children aren’t living with you full time. In the meantime, figure out what caused your husband to rack up so many debts. And consider seeing a couple’s therapist to get to the bottom of why your husband kept this information from you. That way, you can prevent the same thing from happening again.\n\nDon’t miss: I have terminal cancer. Will my elderly mother be responsible for my credit-card debt?\n\nDo you have questions about inheritance, tipping, weddings, family feuds, friends or any tricky issues relating to manners and money?

"Uber, beset by safety criticisms, introduces ‘panic button’",http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B977F2DA6-642B-11E8-BD17-498018EA4E9F%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1,MarketWatch_Top_Stories,MarketWatch,['Kari Paul'],,"['Your ride home may have just gotten a bit safer.\n\nRide-hailing service Uber has introduced a new “911 button” on its app to allow riders to easily call for help in emergencies. The addition was first announced in April and went live on Tuesday across the U.S. Users can now find the emergency button by swiping up on the center icon and tapping “911 assistance.” After confirming the call, they will be patched through to emergency dispatchers.\n\n“Every second counts in an emergency,” Sachin Kansal, Uber’s director of safety products told MarketWatch in a statement. “We want to make sure our users get help quickly with accurate information if faced with an emergency situation.”\n\nIn some test locations the panic button will share user location directly with 911 operators, including Denver, Colorado; Charleston, South Carolina; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Naples, Florida; and Louisville, Kentucky. Uber hopes to soon make it available everywhere, Kansal said.\n\nThe vast majority of emergencies in Uber rides are related to road accidents, a spokeswoman told MarketWatch. But the new panic button could also be used in cases of sexual assault perpetrated by drivers, an issue that has been brought to light by a number of high-profile cases.\n\nA CNN investigation released last April found at least 103 Uber drivers have been accused of sexual assault in the past four years.\n\n“Sexual assault is a horrible crime that has no place anywhere,” an Uber spokesperson told CNN after that report was released. “While Uber is not immune to this societal issue, we want to be part of the solution to end this violence forever.”\n\nIn a statement to MarketWatch, a spokeswoman for Uber said it has “strengthened driver screenings by committing to proactively re-run criminal background and motor vehicle checks each year.” It cited a statement released in May 2018.\n\nActress Pamela Anderson previously released a series of public service announcements in partnership with organizations PAVE, a nonprofit fighting violence against women, and Ride Responsibly, an initiative by the National Limousine Association, which clearly has a vested interest against other ride-sharing apps, calling on ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft to strengthen background checks on drivers.\n\nAnd a lawsuit filed last November by two unnamed women claimed Uber systematically created an unsafe environment for female passengers. The lawsuit sought class-action status on behalf of all U.S. passengers who were “subject to rape, sexual assault or gender-motivated violence or harassment by their Uber driver in the last four years.”\n\nIn May, Uber ended mandatory arbitration policies for claims of sexual harassment and assault. Riders who alleged that they were sexually assaulted by their drivers no longer had to agree to confidentiality as a condition of their settlement. Lyft, an Uber competitor, announced similar changes.\n\nFollowing the new policies, the company said survivors can seek justice however they choose — except by banding together in a class-action lawsuit.\n\nBut Jeanne Christensen, attorney at Wigdor LLP, the New York-based law firm behind the class-action lawsuit issued in 2017, told CNN, “That’s for the court to decide — not Uber.”\n\nIn an April blog post, Uber’s chief executive officer Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is “getting serious” about safety. “Technology can make travel safer than ever before,” he said. “And while there’s been a lot of progress, we’re committed to doing more.”']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FL173_NA_ube_ZG_20170425171446.jpg

New Zealand’s NZX 50 NZ50GR, +0.13% , the lone index in the Asia-Pacific region that rose Wednesday, was up a further 0.3%.\n\nJapanese stocks opened with solid gains.

Roseanne Barr discovered that one bad tweet can upend your life — she’s not alone,http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B5B33BDF8-640D-11E8-AD5D-DBD489DC588D%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1,MarketWatch_Top_Stories,MarketWatch,"['Quentin Fottrell', 'Personal Finance Editor']",,"['If you use Twitter, you too are a public figure. And one egregious tweet could blow up your life.\n\nOn Tuesday, ABC DIS, +0.29% cancelled the wildly successful reboot of “Roseanne” after Roseanne Barr wrote a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former adviser in Barack Obama’s White House. Barr apologized, but the damage was done. Several members of her cast and ABC executives denounced her.\n\nThe cancelation of Barr’s show came some 11 hours after she sent the original tweet. “Roseanne’s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,” Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment, who is black, said in a statement. ICM Partners talent agency also dropped Barr.\n\nThe political climate puts all employers on high alert when it comes to the words and behavior of their employees.\n\nThe swiftness of ABC’s response is a testament to diversity in the C-suite and the speed with which news travels on social media, says Aram Sinnreich, professor of communications at the American University, Washington, D.C.\n\n“It helps that there’s an African-American woman calling the shots,” he said. “It also reflects that, in the Trump age, the news cycle has accelerated so quickly that there’s a vanishingly small window for commercial entities to get out in front of these damaging public relations incidents. The ability to bury these kinds of stories has diminished to almost zero.”\n\nRead also: 50 million American households can’t even afford basic living expenses\n\nThis wasn’t Barr’s first racist tweet. So why now? The political climate is putting all employers on high alert when it comes to the words and behavior of their employees, Sinnreich says. “We’re understood to be private citizens, but when someone is the public face of a public corporation, that corporation should and must be held accountable for the actions of that individual,” he added.\n\nSinnreich says some people are frustrated with the lack of consequences when President Trump tweets racially-tinged comments. “Until the president is held accountable for the outrageous volume of hate speech that he generates, proxies are going to continue to come under the gun.” (President Trump has made incendiary remarks about Mexicans, Haitians and Nigerians.)\n\nAlso see: Why millions of Americans are lonely\n\nWorkers are plugged into the news cycle. That does not mean you should share all your opinions on social media.\n\nMany people are plugged into the news cycle all day long. One in five employers think staff is productive fewer than five hours a day, with most citing smartphone use as the culprit, a 2016 CareerBuilder report of hiring managers found.\n\nThat does not, however, mean you should share all your opinions on social media. The First Amendment protects free speech, but it may not protect your job if you do or say anything that is contrary to the company’s values, even if it’s a joke. In employment-at-will states, employees without a contract can be fired without cause.\n\n“Twitter is today’s PR Newswire,” says Donna Francavilla, a communications specialist in Birmingham, Ala. “We think we’re talking to our followers and we think they’re all loyal to us and, if we issue an opinion, they’ll agree.” That’s not the case, she said. Often times, many people who follow Trump, for instance, may disagree with his views.\n\n“It never used to be that way,” Francavilla said. “Social media used to be just you and your friends. But we’re now using this new megaphone to express our ideas to a much larger audience.” Anyone with a public Twitter account is a de facto public figure, she added. “We have to be mindful of every word we speak and everything we write.”\n\nThere have been some infamous cases. In December 2013, Justine Sacco, a PR executive for InterActiveCorp, IAC, +1.98% which runs dating websites Match.com and OkCupid, was fired after tweeting offensive comments about AIDS in Africa, before stepping on a plane to go there. Her tweet went viral while she was on the long-distance flight.\n\nIAC said at the time: “The offensive comment doesn’t reflect the views and values of IAC.” Sacco later apologized “for being insensitive to this crisis,” and later said the tweet was intended to be satirical. She left IAC in January 2014 and returned in January 2018 as vice president of communications at Match Group.\n\nThere have been some infamous cases of people being fired for tweeting, even when they said it was satire.\n\nAnthony Weiner, the former Democratic congressman for New York, last year began a 21-month prison sentence for sexting with a minor. But he first resigned in June 2011 after sending a sexually explicit photo of himself to a college student over Twitter.\n\nAt first, Weiner claimed that his account was hacked. While he lost his $174,000-a-year job — the standard salary for members of the House and the Senate — he walked away with the equivalent of around $1.2 million in retirement benefits after just a dozen years in office. He later expressed remorse: “These destructive impulses brought great devastation to family and friends, and destroyed my life’s dream of public service,” he said.\n\nDon’t miss: Ambien maker responds to Roseanne: Racism is ‘not a known side effect’\n\nEven posting photographs or retweeting someone else’s tweet can be enough to get fired. Despite repeated warnings, people still get fired for sending an inappropriate photo or tweet. The problem with sites like Twitter and Instagram is that immediacy and informality are also social media’s greatest dangers, experts say.\n\nAnd in many cases, there’s no turning back once you hit “send” and there are plenty of reasons not to. Case in point: Five workers on a dam in Oroville, Calif., were fired earlier this year for taking photos of the dam and posting them on Instagram despite a strict no social media and no photos policy at the site.\n\nAlso see: How America has changed since ‘Roseanne’ premiered in 1988\n\nEmployees often say their opinions do not reflect those of their company, but sometimes even that’s not enough.\n\nFor corporate America, the power of Twitter TWTR, +0.94% can work both ways. In February, Kylie Jenner, start of E!’s “Keeping Up with the Kardashians,” and a fashion empire mogul in her own right, tweeted that she was over Snapchat SNAP, +3.98%\n\n“Sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad,” Jenner tweeted to her 25.5 million Twitter followers. It was liked 374,555 times. Jenner, regarded by her fans as an arbiter of what’s not and what’s not, heard. Snapchat stock dropped 6% or $1.3 billion, also in part over its decision to redesign its interface. Jenner later tweeted, “still love you tho snap ... my first love.”\n\nIn fairness to American workers, it’s a double-edged sword: They’re often times encouraged to tweet and maintain an active social media presence. And employees, particularly those who are in the public eye, are often judged by how many followers they have on Twitter when they apply for jobs.\n\nThe role social media plays in workers’ lives is “not always clear-cut,” the Pew Research Center, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, D.C., found. Companies, in the meantime, must remind employees to state that their opinions do not reflect those of their company. But when it comes to crossing a line — whether it’s racism, homophobia or sexism — such caveats may not enough.\n\n“This is not censorship,” Sinnreich says. “It’s about affiliation and the media’s role as amplifiers for political ideology. This story will be over in another 24 hours, but these stories will keep happening.”']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK067_rosean_ZG_20180530104554.jpg

Two years later, Beats was bought by Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.21% for $3 billion. Since their divorce, Monster and Beats have been entangled in a messy legal dispute over contractual obligations, with Monster arguing that Beats owes it about $100 million, while Beats says it is owed $95 million from Monster.\n\nIn the SEC filing, Monster said it continues to incur operating losses, with a net loss of $26.7 million in 2017, and a $19.6 million loss in the first quarter of 2018. “The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain,” the company said.']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GK100_monste_ZG_20180530201956.jpg

MarketWatch First Take: Box shares sink as forecast indicates slower revenue growth,http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BFC65BC82-6460-11E8-BD17-498018EA4E9F%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1,MarketWatch_Top_Stories,MarketWatch,['Therese Poletti'],,"['Box Inc. saw its shares tumble Wednesday as investors got more nervous about its slowing revenue growth.\n\nEarlier, Box reported fiscal first-quarter results, with revenue and a net loss that were within Wall Street’s expectations, but its outlook indicated continued slower revenue growth for the rest of the year. Box’s full-year outlook called for revenue in the range of $603 million to $608 million, or growth of 20% at the high end of that range, up from fiscal 2018 revenue of $506 million.\n\nWhile 20% growth is nothing to sneeze at for most companies, last year the cloud-storage company had revenue growth of 27%. Shares of Box BOX, +1.94% , which have had a big run-up in recent weeks, fell 4.6% in after-hours trading, while the S&P 500 SPX, +1.27% closed up 1.27% on Wednesday.\n\nIn a brief interview, Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie said the company has moved to a multi-product model and is adding more capabilities, including governance features, more security and artificial intelligence to its offerings. “It will show up in much more into the next fiscal year,” he said.\n\nRead more: Box CEO on Dropbox IPO: We’re like Salesforce, they’re like Netflix\n\nSome questions on the company’s call with analysts were about the pace of getting new customers and whether its new products would contribute much to revenue going forward.\n\n“By now there’s a good five, six, seven [new products], not any of them are broadly adopted or priced in a way that can drive massive revenue growth, correct me if I’m wrong,” one analyst said. Box executives cited new deals that had added “many new logos,” including adding the Defense Department’s DARPA as a new customer.\n\nLevie urged patience, telling analysts that, as the company had discussed in its fiscal fourth-quarter call, over time a greater percentage of overall sales will be coming from those newer products.\n\nBut whether or not Box can get back to its higher growth rates is a big question that investors will keep asking, until they see evidence otherwise.']",http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-FN544_Box053_ZG_20170531175622.jpg

Charcoal versus gas grill: Which one is better?,http://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/2018/05/31/charcoal-versus-gas-grill-which-one-is-better.html,Fox_Latest_Headlines,Fox,[],2018-05-31 00:00:00,"['Everyone has their own opinion when it comes to charcoal and gas grilling. But is there a correct choice?\n\nRather than guessing which to use at your next cookout, we’ve rounded up the pros and cons of charcoal and gas grills so you can make a well-informed decision for what will be the tastiest choice of the summer.\n\nRegardless of the fuel, learn how to grill steaks like a pro by following these 5 easy steps.\n\nCharcoal Grills\n\nAccording to some die-hard barbecue fans, the only way to grill is with charcoal. Charcoal provides that rich, smoky flavor that even with an attached smoke box just can’t meet. Learn more about operating a charcoal grill here.\n\nPros\n\nTypically, charcoal grills reach a higher temperature than gas grills. A grill has to reach a temperature of at least 600 degrees Fahrenheit to achieve a nice sear on your meat. This is no problem for a kettle grill filled with red-hot charcoals as it can reach 700 degrees Fahrenheit. While there are gas grills that can reach higher temperatures, they’re usually on the higher end.\n\nYou get that scrumptious, smoky flavor. Ever wonder how charcoal grills give so much flavor? Turns out, that higher heat is key. When the drippings from your steak, chicken or veggies falls on the hot coals, the drippings turn into flavor-packed steam and smoke that goes right back into the meat, resulting in the amazingly unique taste of charcoal grilling.\n\nThey are easier on your wallet. A basic charcoal grill will run you about $25, while a moderately priced one can be found for around $150. Of course, higher end models go up from there, but in comparison, they are far less than the gas grills that usually cost between $130-$300.\n\nCons\n\nLonger heat up time. Charcoal grills, on average, take about 15-20 minutes to reach the proper cooking temperature (not including the time it takes to light the charcoal), whereas gas grills instantly light up and take about 10 minutes to reach cooking temperature.\n\nWhile you’re waiting for the grill to heat up, toss together some of these delicious summer salads.\n\nFuel cost adds up. A 20-pound propane cylinder can provide around 25 days of cooking time, whereas a 20-pound bag of charcoal will only yield three grilling sessions.\n\nThe cleanup is a bit more cumbersome. As opposed to the gas grill that only needs a quick scrub with a brush, a charcoal grill has to be emptied of its used ashes before it can be scrubbed.\n\nGas Grills\n\nThere’s no denying how convenient gas grills are in terms of start-up and temperature control, but that ease comes with a price.\n\nPros\n\nEasy Temperature Control. Adjusting a grill’s temperature is as easy as turning a dial. This means you can go from the low heat needed for bone-in chicken to searing hot for kebobs or steak without having to worry about moving around hot coals.\n\nQuick Start-Up. With a simple press of the ignition button and a turn of the dial, your gas grill will spark to life. After a quick preheat, you’ll be ready to grill, rather than having to wait for coals to heat up.\n\nVersatility. With a gas grill, you can easily cook delicate foods such as fish, fruit and vegetables without the worry of overpowering the food with the smoke flavor that comes along with charcoal grilling. If the smoke flavor is desired, you can easily add a smoke box that is available with some gas grills. If your grill doesn’t come with one, check out this smoke box that will deliver some serious flavor.\n\nCons\n\nAssembly time. As opposed to the charcoal grill that can be set up in a jiffy, a mid-range gas model is a bit more complicated to assemble and hook up to a propane tank.\n\nSafety. While there are safety precautions to follow with any form of cooking, you have to be extra-careful when cooking with a gas grill. Always make sure that your propane tank is properly attached without leaks, your grill is at least 10 feet from your home and deck and that the grill is free from grease. Not sure how to best clean your grill? Follow this simple check-list that’ll leave your grill looking brand-new!\n\nPortability. Though travel-sized gas grills are available, it would be much too difficult, and dangerous, to tow a full-sized gas grill around to the park or the beach.\n\nThe End Result\n\nThe charcoal and the gas grill have their pro and cons, but only you can decide which would be best for your family and lifestyle. With so many delicious grilling recipes to cook up this summer, you can’t go wrong either way.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Taste of Home.']",http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/food-drink/2018/05/31/charcoal-versus-gas-grill-which-one-is-better/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1527714571826.jpg?ve=1
How could an American high school let misunderstanding and fear triumph over love and freedom at graduation?,http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2018/05/31/how-could-american-high-school-let-misunderstanding-and-fear-triumph-over-love-and-freedom-at-graduation.html,Fox_Latest_Headlines,Fox,['Jeremy Dys'],2018-05-31 00:00:00,"[""Mere minutes before Sam Blackledge should have given his valedictory address in front of his loved ones and classmates May 19, the principal of West Prairie High School in Sciota, Illinois took him aside.\n\nBlackledge, 18, was presented with a terrible choice: censor his speech, removing any religious references, or don't speak at his own graduation. Blackledge earned the right to speak to his classmates as valedictorian. He believes this achievement – his 4.0 GPA – would not have been possible without his faith.\n\nThe student told Fox News that he was specifically barred from mentioning Jesus Christ in his speech because “the principal told me it wasn’t appropriate for the setting.”\n\n“The most important thing in my life is Christ,” Blackledge told Fox News. “Christ is the only reason I was a valedictorian. He’s the reason I got that 4.0. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be up there. I was giving him the credit for that.”\n\nWhat is so dangerous about a young man having the humility to acknowledge that his success would not have been possible without his faith that he must be kept from the podium?\n\nThe young man should have been congratulated for his academic achievements and his speech, with themes of the triumph of justice, love, and forgiveness over evil. Instead, on what was supposed to be a joyous day for Blackledge and his family, misunderstanding and fear triumphed over love and freedom.\n\nThat school officials would censor Blackledge’s speech and deny him the freedom to share this essential part of his identity with his loved ones and classmates is inexcusable.\n\nHow many more high school graduations must be ruined by school officials who, by misunderstanding or intentional act, deny their pupils their constitutional rights to freedom of expression from the schoolhouse gates all the way through the graduation ceremony?\n\nWhat is so dangerous about a young man having the humility to acknowledge that his success would not have been possible without his faith that he must be kept from the podium?\n\nWhy is this reference to his religious identity treated any differently than another student crediting a family member for his achievements?\n\nSchool officials have us believe that humility is apparently offensive on the one hand and on the other it is virtuous.\n\nNo one thinks that a school owns the content of private speech by a valedictorian just because it occurs on school property. But even if someone thought such a misunderstanding could occur, school officials could have clarified the matter, as the U.S. Department of Education suggests, by making “appropriate, neutral disclaimers to clarify that such speech (whether religious or nonreligious) is the speaker’s and not the school’s.”\n\nJudge Frank Easterbrook writing for the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in the 1993 decision of Hedges v. Wauconda Community Unit School District, explained that, rather than censor religious speech, it is far better for schools “to educate the audience rather than squelch the speaker.”\n\nThe judge explained in the decision that if a school district cannot teach the difference between providing a forum for private speech and school-sponsored speech, it is doubtful that the school is capable of teaching anything at all.\n\nIt’s unfortunate that Blackledge’s school did not heed Judge Easterbrook’s important instruction: “Schools may not prohibit their pupils from expressing ideas. And no arm of government may discriminate against religious speech when speech on other subjects is permitted in the same place at the same time.”\n\nFirst Liberty Institute, which represents Sam Blackledge, is working to ensure future valedictorians aren’t denied their freedom. We’ve asked the school to apologize to him for ruining his only high school graduation. In addition, we’ve offered to meet with school officials to help them craft policies that will ensure what happened to Blackledge doesn’t happen to anyone else.\n\nWhen all religious speech is censored then the purpose of education – and the First Amendment – is frustrated.

"Ex-USC med school dean linked to drugs, prostitutes shouldn't lose license, attorney argues",http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/05/31/ex-usc-med-school-dean-linked-to-drugs-prostitutes-shouldnt-lose-license-attorney-argues.html,Fox_Latest_Headlines,Fox,['Benjamin Brown'],2018-05-31 00:00:00,"[""The attorney for a former medical school dean at the University of Southern California argued Wednesday that his client should be allowed to continue practicing medicine, despite acknowledging that he used hard drugs during his tenure at USC.\n\nAttorney Peter Osinoff made the case on behalf of Dr. Carmen A. Puliafito during a state medical board hearing that followed Puliafito's March 2016 resignation from the university -- one of several high-profile departures from the school in recent years.\n\nOsinoff argued that while 67-year-old Puliafito has a brilliant mind, he also suffers from mental illness, which induced an “ugly side” that led to his relationship with a prostitute, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nHe noted that Puliafito was more addicted to his involvement with the young woman, identified in a previous report by the Times as Sarah Warren, than the narcotics – and asserted that Warren was the one who introduced the physician to “street drugs.”\n\nOsinoff argued his client has been recovering for several months and has since gotten a grasp on his bipolar disorder, according to the paper.\n\nPuliafito resigned as the dean of USC’s Keck School of Medicine in three weeks after Warren, 21, overdosed in a Pasadena hotel in his company, according to a detailed investigation by the Times.\n\nThe physician continued to represent the school and see patients at the university until the paper published its investigation last year that revealed Puliafito lived a secret life of drinking, drug use and partying with addicts and prostitutes.\n\nThe report, which prompted the medical board to suspend Puliafito's license, turned out to be just the beginning of a series of scandals to rock the university.\n\nPuliafito’s successor, Dr. Rohit Varma, was ousted less than a year after being appointed following revelations of a sexual harassment settlement from 15 years earlier, in which a woman accused him of unwanted sexual advances in 2002.\n\nMost recently, USC gynecologist Dr. George Tyndall, 71, was accused of sexual abuse by more than 50 women over the course of more than two decades following a bombshell report by the Los Angeles Times earlier this month that the women had complained about the physician’s behavior for years -- with the school taking no action until 2016.\n\nThe Tyndall scandal led USC President C.L. Max Nikias, 65, to announce his resignation Friday.\n\nTyndall has denied any wrongdoing in interviews with the Times.\n\nDuring Wednesday’s hearing, the state medical board alleged that Puliafito would “see patients within hours of using methamphetamine,” in addition to providing drugs and paraphernalia to Warren, and her brother Charles Warren, who was 17 at the time, the paper reported, citing a filing.\n\nOsinoff denied those claims, arguing his client never treated patients while under the influence of drugs, nor did he ever illegally supply drugs, adding that Puliafito hasn’t used methamphetamine since last July, according to the paper.\n\nThe attorney argued Warren drugged Puliafito “without his consent,” while he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on clothes, housing and rehab among other things for her.\n\nOsinoff also claimed Warren’s parents tried to extort money from Puliafito, but Sarah and Charles Warren denied the allegations, the Times reported.\n\nPuliafito attended the hearing, which will determine whether the physician can continue practicing.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.""]",http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/us/2018/05/31/ex-usc-med-school-dean-linked-to-drugs-prostitutes-shouldnt-lose-license-attorney-argues/_jcr_content/par/featured_image/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1527745407951.jpg?ve=1
Day of US-NKorea meetings to salvage summit on tap in NYC,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2018/05/31/day-us-nkorea-meetings-to-salvage-summit-on-tap-in-nyc.html,Fox_Latest_Headlines,Fox,[],2018-05-31 00:00:00,"['A senior North Korean official and the top U.S. diplomat had dinner in New York as President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un try to salvage prospects for a high-stakes nuclear summit. It\'s the highest-level official North Korean visit to the United States in 18 years.\n\nKim Yong Chol, the former military intelligence chief and one of the North Korean leader\'s closest aides, landed midafternoon Wednesday on an Air China flight from Beijing. Associated Press journalists saw the plane taxi down the tarmac before the North\'s delegation disembarked at JFK International Airport.\n\nDuring his unusual visit, Kim Yong Chol had dinner for about an hour-and-a-half with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who traveled from Washington to see him. The two planned a ""day full of meetings"" Thursday, the White House said. Their talks will be aimed at determining whether a meeting between Trump and Kim Jong Un, originally scheduled for June 12 but later canceled by Trump, can be restored, U.S. officials have said.\n\nThe talks come as preparations for the highly anticipated summit in Singapore were barreling forward on both sides of the Pacific Ocean, despite lingering uncertainty about whether it will really occur, and when. As Kim and Pompeo were meeting in New York, other U.S. teams were meeting with North Korean officials in Singapore and in the heavily fortified Korean Demilitarized Zone.\n\n""If it happens, we\'ll certainly be ready,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said of the Singapore summit. Regarding the date for the meeting, she added, ""We\'re going to continue to shoot for June 12th.""\n\nNorth Korea\'s flurry of diplomatic activity following a torrid run in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests that Kim Jong Un is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy and the international legitimacy the summit with Trump would provide. But there are lingering doubts on whether Kim will ever fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.\n\nTrump announced that Kim Yong Chol was coming to New York for talks with Pompeo in a tweet on Tuesday in which he said he had a ""great team"" working on the summit. That was a shift from last week, when Trump announced in an open letter to Kim Jong Un that he had decided to ""terminate"" the summit following a provocative statement from the North.\n\nPompeo, Trump\'s former CIA chief, has traveled to Pyongyang twice in recent weeks for meetings with Kim Jong Un, and has said there is a ""shared understanding"" between the two sides about what they hope to achieve in talks. South Korean media speculated that Pompeo could make a third trip to Pyongyang and that Kim Yong Chol was carrying a personal letter from Kim Jong Un and might push to travel to Washington to meet with Trump.\n\nNorth Korea\'s mission to the United Nations in New York is its sole diplomatic presence in the United States. That suggests Kim might have chosen to first go to New York because it would make it easier for him to communicate with officials in Pyongyang, North Korea\'s capital. North Korea and the United States are still technically at war and have no diplomatic ties because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.\n\nTrump views a summit as a legacy-defining opportunity to make the nuclear deal that has evaded others, but he pledged to walk away from the meeting if he believed the North wasn\'t serious about discussing dismantling its nuclear program.\n\nAfter the North\'s combative statements, there was debate inside the Trump administration about whether it marked a real turn to belligerence or a feint to see how far Kim Jong Un could push the U.S. in the lead-up to the talks. Trump had mused that Kim\'s ""attitude"" had changed after the North Korean leader\'s surprise visit to China two weeks ago, suggesting China was pushing Kim away from the table. Trump\'s letter, the aides said, was designed to pressure the North on the international stage for appearing to have cold feet.\n\nWhite House officials maintain that Trump was hopeful the North was merely negotiating but that he was prepared for the letter to mark the end of the two-month flirtation. Instead, the officials said, it brought both sides to the table with increasing seriousness, as they work through myriad logistical and policy decisions to keep June 12 a viable option for the summit.\n\nKim Yong Chol is a vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party\'s central committee. The last official of his stature to visit the United States was Jo Myong Rok, the late first vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, who visited Washington in 2000, South Korea\'s Unification Ministry said.\n\nThe White House emphasized that it has remained in close contact with South Korean and Japanese officials as preparations for the talks continue. Spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump will host Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan on June 7 to coordinate their thinking ahead of the summit. Trump hosted South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week.\n\nMoon, who has lobbied hard for nuclear negotiations between Trump and Kim Jong Un, held a surprise meeting with the North Korean leader on Saturday in an effort to keep the summit alive.\n\n___\n\nLederman reported from Washington and Bodeen from Beijing.

The former Democratic Party nominee considered the question Friday at Harvard University and said she would like to run Facebook.\n\nDuring an event at which she received the prestigious Radcliffe Medal for “transformative impact on society,” Clinton was asked which company she would like to lead as CEO.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Clinton named Facebook, noting that the social media giant has vast power and controls the flow of information.\n\n“It’s the biggest news platform in the world … but most people in our country get their news, true or not, from Facebook,” she said.\n\nThe response drew mixed reactions on social media, though the attempt to put her name on the table may not be so out of the ordinary. Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg openly endorsed Clinton’s candidacy while a co-founder of the social media giant, Dustin Moskovitz, led a nearly $30 million effort to defeat now-President Donald Trump.\n\nOther Facebook employees contributed more money to Clinton's campaign -- some $114,000 -- than to those of any other candidate, according to Federal Election Commission data that takes into account only donations over $200, the Hill reported.\n\nBut the former U.S. secretary of state’s openness to run Facebook came at the time when the tech company is coping with a number of scandals, including alleged misuse of user data that allowed political campaigns, including possibly Clinton’s, to target potential voters after acquiring the data of millions of people.\n\nJust this week, Facebook was accused of deceptive tactics to pressure people to accept its privacy policy. According to a complaint filed by the European Center for Digital Rights on behalf of an anonymous individual, the platform blocked users who didn’t consent to the new privacy policies and used “tricks” – including fake message notifications – to pressure them into agreeing with the policies.\n\n“[Facebook] used additional ‘tricks’ to pressure the users: For example, the consent page included two fake red dots … that indicated that the user has new messages and notifications, which he/she cannot access without consenting — even if the user did not have such notifications or messages in reality,” the complaint reads, according to Australia's News.co.au.\n\nCLINTON CAMPAIGN APP MAY HAVE HARVESTED FACEBOOK DATA OF MILLIONS\n\nBut similar to Cambridge Analytica, the company that was forced to shut down amid the data misuse scandal, the Clinton campaign itself may have harvested the data of potentially millions of users to get an edge over Trump.\n\nIn the midst of the election, Clinton's campaign launched a mobile application called “Hillary 2016” that allowed every user to pair their friends list on Facebook with their phone contacts – and give the campaign permission to access that info.\n\nPeople who didn’t download the application - or weren’t even Clinton supporters – weren’t given an option to prohibit their Facebook friends from pairing their phone numbers with Facebook accounts and indicate their likelihood of voting for the Democratic candidate.""]",http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/05/25/0/0/694940094001_5789844228001_5789843101001-vs.jpg?ve=1
